#  App Administration { #app-administration } 
The Standalone Action Tracker App includes a module for administrators to configure key metadata for the normal user. The administration configurable options include:

1. **_General settings:_** management of planning period, tracking period and planning organization unit level.
2. **_Challenge identification methods:_** management of allowable methods that users may select as methods used to identify challenges for the plans and actions to be documented.
3. **_Action status option:_** management of possible status options for actions to be documented and tracked.

**Managing general settings**

The genera settings allow users to manage the following three options:

1. **_Tracking period:_** This is the period that users will be allowed to register actions for and track status of their execution. For defined organization unit level, users will only be able to select periods as per the predefined period type selected here.
2. **_Planning period:_** This is the period that users will be allowed to register plans for each organization unit. For defined organization unit level, users will only be able to select the planning period as the predefined period type selected here.
3. **_Planning organization unit:_** This is the allowable planning level at which users will be allowed to register plans to be tracked. If for the given DHIS2 instance usage, planning is done at council level, then the user should select council level during this configuration.

## Managing challenges identification methods  { #managing-challenges-identification-methods } 

This option allows administrative users to define methods that can be associated with documentation of the challenges for the interventions to be tracked. When documenting interventions and actions, normal users will be required to select what method was used to identify the challenge to be tracked. This administration module allows definition of such methods.
