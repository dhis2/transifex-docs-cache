Select the saved visualization "Index Case - Contacts"

You will now be asked to select an enrollment start and end date. The data and relationships in this database are for March 2020.

In this example, the blue dots represent our cases and the purple dots are the contacts. We then have a line connecting each case to its contact. Select a case or a contact to pull up their information.

## Exercise 2 { #exercise-2 } 

### Review the COVID-19 Health Pass { #review-the-covid-19-health-pass } 

The COVID-19 health pass app was made to generate an internal health pass with related COVID-19 vaccination data on it. It is a "health pass" because it is meant for internal use only, as it does not use any international schema that would be accepted by other governments for international travel. Solutions that use such schemas are also being tested however and this pass could use one in the future.

From the dashboard access the app "Pass Sanitaire" -- this is health pass but in French as this app was developed for French speaking communities. 

![pass_sanitaire](resources/images/custom_apps/pass_sanitaire.png)

If using chrome, you should be able to translate the app to English via Google Translate.

![translate](resources/images/custom_apps/translate.png)

In order to use the app to generate the pass, you must have the ID of a person. 

For example, we can use the ID : ID-2198323

![health_pass_search](resources/images/custom_apps/health_pass_search.png)

Once you enter the ID, search for the record. It will populate the details of the pass.

![pass_output](resources/images/custom_apps/pass_output.png)

The QR code shown here contains the following information: first name, surname, sex, the name of the vaccine and the dates of the doses. It is important to note that other information can be added or removed to the QR as required (within reason). It will depend on the country or organization that wants to implement it.

You are able to print or download the pass using the print button.

To read the code, you need a separate android app. For more details on this app, refer to the [user manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qWyOcyCmQXsmG9FG91WIocNBvWmLkJT3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104677221247573000314&rtpof=true&sd=true).
