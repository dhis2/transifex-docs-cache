## About the Dashboards app { #about-the-dashboards-app } 

The Dashboards app makes it possible to present a high level overview of your data, including displaying analytical objects such as maps, charts, reports and tables, as well as displaying text-based information, resource links, and app widgets.

Features of the Dashboards app include:

- View and print dashboards
- Create and edit dashboards
- Share dashboards with users and user groups
- Apply temporary filters while viewing dashboards
- Responsive view on mobile devices and small screens
- Access dashboards while offline

## Dashboards app layout { #dashboards_setup }

Dashboards have a title, description, and any number of dashboard items. Above the dashboard is the dashboards bar, which shows all your available dashboards, a dashboard search field, and a **+** button for creating a new dashboard.

The Dashboards app has two modes: _view_ and _edit/create_. When you first log in
to DHIS2, your most recently used dashboard will be displayed in view mode, if you are on the same computer as you were previously. If you are using a different computer or browser, then the first starred dashboard will be displayed. If there are no starred dashboards, then the first dashboard (alphabetically) will be displayed. Starred dashboards always show first in the dashboard list.

Below is an example of a dashboard named "Antenatal Care", which has been populated with charts and maps:

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-view-mode.png)

### Personalization { #personalization } 

The Dashboards app can be personalized in the following ways:

- [Set the height of the dashboards bar](#dashboards_personalize_bar)
- [Star dashboards for quick access to your favorite dashboards](#dashboard-star-dashboard)
- [Show or hide dashboard description](#dashboard-show-description)

### 小屏幕上的响应视图 { #responsive-view-on-small-screens } 

When viewing dashboards on small screens (for instance, portrait orientation on a mobile phone ), the dashboard will adapt to the screen and show all items in a single column. Some options, including editing, filtering and sharing, will not be available.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-small-screen.png)

### Searching for a dashboard { #searching-for-a-dashboard } 

You can search for a specific dashboard using the search field in the upper left of the dashboards bar entitled “Search for a dashboard”. The search is case insensitive, and as you type, the list of dashboards will be narrowed down to those that match your search text.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-search-for-dashboard.png)

### Personalizing the height of the dashboards bar { #dashboards_personalize_bar }

You can set a specific height for the dashboards bar by
down-clicking and dragging the bottom edge of the bar. When you finish dragging, the new height will be set. Clicking on the down arrow at the bottom of the dashboards bar will expand the bar to its maximum height (10 "rows"). Clicking on the up arrow will reset the height to your personalized height.

## Creating and editing a dashboard { #creating-and-editing-a-dashboard } 

To create a new dashboard, click the **+** button in the left corner of the dashboards bar to enter create/edit mode:

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-new-button.png)

To edit an existing dashboard, click the **Edit** button next to the dashboard title (you must have edit access to see this button):

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-title-bar.png)

In create/edit mode, you can add or change the dashboard title, description and dashboard items. If you do not add a title, the dashboard will automatically be titled "Untitled dashboard".

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-create-mode.png)

### 将项目添加到仪表板 { #adding-items-to-the-dashboard } 

Add items to the dashboard by searching for items using the **Search for items to add to this dashboard** drop down selector. Item types are:

- Visualizations (charts and tables)
- 地图
- 活动报告
- 活动图
- Reports
- 资源资源
- 应用
- Messages
- 文字框
- Spacers

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-item-selector.png)

The list of items in the drop-down initially displays 10 visualizations (charts and tables), and 5 from each of the other categories, based on the search text you enter. Messages (Email), text boxes and spacer items are also found in the list. To view more items, click on **Show more**, and the list for that type will be extended to 25 items. If you still do not find the item you want, try typing a more specific search text.

#### Dashboard layout and placement of new items { #dashboard-layout-and-placement-of-new-items } 

When adding items to the dashboard you can choose an overall layout by clicking on **Change layout** button. You can change this layout setting at any time.

- With _Freeflow_ layout, the added items can be moved using the mouse by down-clicking on the item and dragging it to the desired position. Items can also be resized with the mouse by down-clicking on the drag handle in the lower right corner of the item and dragging to the desired size.
- With _Fixed columns_ layout, you can choose the number of columns to have on the dashboard, and the dashboard will automatically be layed out for you. Items cannot be moved or resized in _Fixed columns_ layout.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-layout-modal.png)

You can also configure whether newly added items are automatically placed at the start or end of the dashboard by choosing the desired option. This option can be changed at any time.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-place-items.png)

#### 垫片项目 { #spacer-items } 

When adding items to the dashboard using _Freeflow_ layout, they will "rise" upwards until they bump into another item. In order to force empty vertical space between items (like an empty row), you can add spacer items to the dashboard. They are only visible in edit/create mode. In view mode, they are not displayed, but take up the defined space.

**编辑/创建模式**中的空格：

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-spacer-edit-mode.png)

**查看模式下的垫片**：

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-spacer-view-mode.png)

#### 移除物品 { #removing-items } 

Remove items by clicking on the red trash can at the upper right of the item. Be aware that when you remove an item while in _Freeflow_ layout, the items that are positioned below the removed item will "rise" upwards until they bump into an item above.

### Actions in create/edit mode { #actions-in-createedit-mode } 

在创建/编辑模式下，您将在页面顶部的操作栏中看到以下按钮：
**保存更改**、**打印预览**、**过滤器设置**、**翻译**、**删除**和**退出而不保存**。 **翻译** 和 **删除** 按钮仅在您正在编辑现有仪表板时显示。

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-edit-mode-actions.png)

### 保存仪表板 { #saving-the-dashboard } 

When creating or editing a dashboard, changes are saved when you click the **Save changes** button. If you don't want to save your changes, click the **Exit without saving** button. You will then be returned to view mode with the dashboard you were previously viewing.

### 打印预览 { #print-preview } 

Click on the **Print preview** button to view what the dashboard will look like when being printed with the [Dashboard layout option](#dashboard-print-layout).

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-edit-print-preview.png)

Click on **Exit print preview** to return to editing the dashboard.

Note that some items may be moved to the next page to avoid being split between two pages. Items may also be shortened to fit on one page. Items that are shortened show an info icon in the upper right corner of the item in preview. The info icon is not visible in the actual print.

### 限制仪表板过滤器 { #restricting-dashboard-filters }

By default, users will be able to filter dashboard items by any dimension defined in the DHIS2 instance. Dashboard filter settings can be edited for a dashboard by clicking on **Filter settings**.

To restrict available filters, you can click **Only allow filtering by selected dimensions** and select the filters you wish to allow on the dashboard. Period and Organisation Unit are selected by default but can be removed if desired. When the dashboard is viewed, users will only be able to choose from among the filters selected.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-filter-settings.png)

In order to save updates to filter settings, you need to first click **Confirm** to close the Filter settings dialog and then click **Save changes** to save the dashboard changes.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-save-changes.png)

### 翻译仪表板标题和描述 { #translating-dashboard-title-and-description } 

If you are editing an existing dashboard, then there will be a **Translate** button. Click on this button to open the Translation dialog, which provides a list of languages to translate to, and shows the original dashboard title underneath the name input field. First choose the language you want to translate for, then fill in the dashboard name and description translation.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-translation-dialog.png)

### 删除仪表板 { #deleting-a-dashboard } 

If you have access to delete the dashboard, then there will be a **Delete** button. When you click the **Delete** button, a confirmation dialog will first be displayed to confirm that you want to delete the dashboard.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-confirm-delete.png)

## 查看仪表板 { #viewing-a-dashboard } 

From view mode, you can toggle showing the description, star a dashboard, apply filters, print the dashboard, make the dashboard available offline, and share the dashboard with other users and user groups.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-more-menu.png)

### Show description { #dashboard-show-description }

To toggle the description, open the **...More** menu and choose **Show description** (or **Hide description**). This setting will be remembered for all dashboards that you open. This setting applies to you, not other users.

### Star dashboards { #dashboard-star-dashboard }

Your starred dashboards are listed first in the list of dashboards for quick access. To star a dashboard, click on the star button to the right of the title. You can also toggle the star from the **...More** menu. When the star is “filled”, that means the dashboard is starred. Starring a dashboard only applies to you, not other users.

### 筛选仪表板 { #filtering-a-dashboard } 

Applying filters to a dashboard change the data displayed in dashboard items containing visualizations. The filters are applied to each dashboard item in the same way: each added filter overrides the original value for that dimension in the original chart, table or map. It is possible to filter on Organisation Units and Periods, as well as dynamic dimensions, depending on the DHIS2 instance. You can apply multiple filters to the dashboard.

To add a filter, click on the **Add Filter** button and choose a dimension:

![添加过滤器](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-filters.png)

将打开一个对话框，您可以在其中选择过滤器。

![组织单位过滤器选择](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-orgunit-filter-dialog.png)

单击对话框中的 **Confirm** 将过滤器应用到
当前仪表板。

Filters are not stored, so when switching to a different dashboard they are reset. Black filter badges appear above the dashboard items to indicate which filters have been applied to the dashboard's visualizations.

![当前过滤器显示为仪表板上方的标志](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-filter-badges.png)

You can edit a filter by clicking on the filter badge to open the filter selection dialog. A filter can be removed by clicking on the **Remove** button on the badge. Whenever a filter is added, edited or removed, the dashboard items reload to show the updated data. The filter badges are always visible at the top of the page when scrolling the dashboard content.

By default, users are able to filter dashboard items by any dimension defined in the DHIS2 instance. To limit available filters, see [Restricting dashboard filters](#restricting-dashboard-filters).

### Making dashboards available offline { #making-dashboards-available-offline } 

To make a dashboard available offline, choose the **Make dashboard available offline** option in the **...More** menu. This will cause a reload of the dashboard where requests to the server are recorded and saved in browser storage. Note that offline dashboards are only available on the computer and browser where you set it to offline. If you currently have a filter applied when requesting the dashboard be made available offline, a dialog will appear to confirm the removal of the filters.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-clear-filters-to-sync.png)

Dashboards that have been saved for offline have an indicator on the dashboard chip in the dashboards bar, as well as a tag showing the time it was saved.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-offline-dashboard.png)

If the dashboard has been changed since you made it available offline, either by you or someone else, you'll need to choose **Sync offline data now** from the **...More** menu to save the latest version of the dashboard.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-sync-offline.png)

You can remove a dashboard from offline storaged by choosing **Remove from offline storage** in the **...More** menu.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-remove-offline.png)

#### Other notes about Dashboards app when you are offline: { #other-notes-about-dashboards-app-when-you-are-offline } 

If you manually log out of the DHIS2 instance, all cached dashboards will be cleared and they will no longer be available offline.

If you are offline, any buttons or actions that require a connection to complete successfully are disabled. They will be re-enabled once connectivity is restored.

### 打印仪表板 { #printing-a-dashboard } 

From the **...More** menu you can print the current dashboard. There are two styles of dashboard print: _Dashboard layout_ and _One item per page_. For both styles, a title page is added that shows the dashboard title, description (if the _Show description_ setting is enabled), and any applied dashboard filters.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-print-menu.png)

为了获得最佳打印效果：

- 使用Chrome或Edge
- 等到所有仪表板项目都已加载后再打印
- use A4 landscape setting with default margins set and background graphics turned on

#### Print dashboard layout { #dashboard-print-layout }

_Dashboard layout_ print will approximate the dashboard layout as it is shown in the browser. Note that some adjustments may need to be made to the layout in order to prevent items being split onto multiple pages: items that would be cut off by a page break are moved to the next page, and items that are taller than one page are shortened to fit on one page.

Once in print mode, click on the **Print** button in the upper right to trigger the browser print functionality.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-print-layout.png)

#### 每页打印一项 { #print-one-item-per-page } 

This style of print will print each dashboard item on a separate page, maximizing the use of the paper size.

单击右上角的**打印**按钮以触发浏览器打印功能。

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-print-oipp.png)

## 带有图表、数据透视表或地图的仪表板项目 { #dashboard-items-with-charts-pivot-tables-or-maps } 

Dashboard items with charts, pivot table or maps may have an item menu button in the upper right corner of the item with additional viewing options, depending on the system settings that have been configured for the DHIS2 instance. If all the relevant system settings have been disabled by the DHIS2 instance, then there will not be an item menu button. Here are the possible item menu options:

### 在可视化之间切换 { #switching-between-visualizations } 

It is possible to toggle the visualization view for items containing charts, pivot tables and maps. Click on the item menu button and choose the desired view (e.g., **View as Table**, **View as Map**, **View as Chart**):

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-item-menu.png)

### 全屏查看项目 { #view-item-in-fullscreen } 

要全屏查看图表、表格或地图，请单击**查看全屏**选项。要退出全屏，您可以按 **esc** 键或单击全屏视图右上角的退出按钮。

### 在应用程序中打开 { #open-in-app } 

To open the visualization in its corresponding app (e.g., Data Visualizer, Maps) click on the **Open in [app name] app** option.

## 共享仪表板 { #dashboard_sharing }

In order to share a dashboard with users and user groups, click on the **Share** button to the right of the dashboard title to display the _Sharing and access_ dialog.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-sharing-dialog.png)

There are three levels of sharing permissions available for a dashboard:

- No access

  The user or user group cannot view or edit the dashboard. If they try to access the dashboard with the url, the Dashboards app will display the message "Requested dashboard not found".

- View only

  The user or user group can view the dashboard but cannot edit it.

- View and edit

  The user or user group can view and edit the dashboard. This level of sharing allows for all types of changes, including altering the layout, resizing and removing items, renaming and deleting the dashboard, etc.

All dashboards have the _All users_ group set to **No access** by default. The _All users_ group includes all logged-in users.

### Add users and user groups { #add-users-and-user-groups } 

To share a dashboard with specific users and user groups, type the name in the input field, choose the desired access level and click on **Give access**.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-sharing-add-user.png)

You can provide users with the url of the dashboard, allowing them to navigate directly to the dashboard. To get the dashboard url, just open the dashboard in view mode, and copy the browser url. For example, the url to the Antenatal Care dashboard in play.dhis2.org/dev is:

https://play.dhis2.org/dev/dhis-web-dashboard/#/nghVC4wtyzi

### Cascade sharing of visualizations on the dashboard { #cascade-sharing-of-visualizations-on-the-dashboard } 

To ensure that all charts, maps and tables on the dashboard are shared with the chosen users and user groups, click on the **Apply sharing to dashboard items** button.

![](resources/images/dashboard/dashboard-sharing-cascade-sharing.png)
