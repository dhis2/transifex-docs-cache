# 结核病例监测{ #tb-cs-design-101 }

## 摘要{ #summary }

The TB Case Surveillance Tracker digital data package for DHIS2 is based on the [WHO recording and reporting framework from 2013.](https://www.who.int/tb/publications/definitions/en/) It provides a set of recommended metadata (data elements, program rules, etc) to enable electronic capture of individual/case-based TB surveillance data. The tracker metadata is configured to ensure that aggregated standard quarterly TB report indicators on notifications, first-line outcomes and second-line outcomes as defined by the [WHO Definitions and reporting framework for TB (2013)](https://www.who.int/tb/publications/definitions/en/) can be automatically generated from the individual data captured. The TB Case Surveillance Tracker is **not** intended to support patient management or patient care. This requires more detailed analysis of roles, responsibilities, workflows and decision-making within the settings in which such systems would be implemented.

## 目的和目标受众{ #purpose-intended-audience }

本文件介绍了基于世界卫生组织技术指南和元数据要求的结核病（TB）病例监测标准 DHIS2 追踪程序的概念设计、内容和功能。

本文件面向各国负责实施结核病数据系统和/或 HMIS 的受众，包括

1. 系统管理员/HMIS 协调员：负责安装元数据包、设计和维护 HMIS 和/或结核病数据系统的人员
2. 结核病计划协调人，负责监督国家结核病计划的数据收集、管理、分析和报告职能
3. 实施支持专家，例如向结核病计划或 HMIS 核心单位提供技术援助的专家，以支持和维护 DHIS2，使其成为国家卫生信息系统和/或结核病数据系统

系统设计文件解释了如何配置跟踪程序，以满足数据录入和分析要求，并支持典型的工作流程。该文件没有详尽列出所采集的所有元数据。该文件也未考虑实施此类系统所需的资源和基础设施，如服务器、电源、互联网连接、备份、培训和用户支持。有关结核病计划技术方面的更多信息，请参阅 _[世界卫生组织关于结核病护理与控制电子记录和报告的出版物](http://www.who.int/tb/publications/electronic_recording_reporting/en/)_. Supplementary implementation guidance for DHIS2 can be found in the [General DHIS2 Implementation Guide](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/configuring-the-android-app/about-this-guide.html) 和[DHIS2 追踪器实施指南]。(https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/understanding-dhis2-implementation/a-quick-guide-to-dhis2-implementation.html)

## 背景 { #background }

Reliable epidemiological data is required for staff at all levels of a national TB programme to plan and provide effective tuberculosis care and control services, as well as monitor the performance of programmatic actions. A case-based surveillance system has clear advantages over an aggregate data collection system. Like an aggregate surveillance system a **_minimum set_** of epidemiological indicators can be captured, validated, aggregated, calculated and displayed but these can be disaggregated by **any combination** of time, location/area, age, sex, case type, previous treatment history, HIV status, drug resistance status and treatment regimens. This helps us to understand TB epidemiology in depth and monitor changes over time.

基于病例的电子数据有望**提高数据质量**，因为数据录入步骤减少，系统可内置自动计算和验证功能，单个记录中不一致、错误或不完整的数据可快速更正或补全，并可进行重复数据删除以去除重复记录。以病例为基础的监测系统还应允许将监测记录与同一病例联系起来，即使结核病例在治疗过程中在不同机构之间转移或转诊。

在国家层面，基于病例的数据可以与其他数据源（如艾滋病毒或糖尿病数据库）进行常规匹配，以衡量并发症的负担并改善患者护理；也可以与其他结核病数据源进行匹配，以量化向国家结核病防治计划（NTP）报告结核病例不足的程度。将结核病临床数据与实验室的结核病基因分型数据相匹配，还可以发现和调查疫情，以便采取公共卫生行动。

最后，病例数据可用于流行病学观察研究，支持在科学证据的基础上就计划变更做出明智的决策。获取的数据不应超出上述目的。

See principle 2.4, page 16, of _Policy on the Protection of personal Data of Persons of Concern to UNHCR_ ([http://www.refworld.org/docid/55643c1d4.html](http://www.refworld.org/docid/55643c1d4.html))

## 系统设计概述{ #system-design-overview }

### 使用案例{ #use-case }

The TB Case Surveillance Tracker enables registration and longitudinal tracking of TB cases from the point of notification to final case outcome, inclusive of laboratory results. The program captures a minimum set of data points required for epidemiological analysis of case surveillance data as described in the background section. These include baseline and demographic information about the case, risk factors, laboratory results, drug resistance type classification, treatment regimens provided, and case outcome. This tracker program is _not_ designed to support clinical management nor patient care. The program serves as an electronic registry that supports decentralized electronic data capture of case surveillance data down to health facility level; parts of the tracker program are also configured to allow data entry directly by laboratories. Depending on infrastructure and resource availability in-country, data entry can also be conducted at the district or higher levels based on paper registers.

各国的工作流程可能各不相同，病例监控计划应根据当地情况进行必要的调整。例如，本设计假定，在临床就诊时获得基线信息和风险因素后，病例将首先输入基于 DHIS2 的电子登记系统。然而，在某些情况下，病例可能会在获得实验室结果后首先输入电子系统，而基线信息则是通过回顾性方式输入的，在这种情况下，计划的各个阶段可以重新排序。

### 计划结构{ #program-structure }

DHIS2 中的程序结构如下：

![System Design](resources/images/TB_CS_System_Design.png)

## 跟踪器程序配置{ #tracker-program-configuration }

### 计划详情{ #program-details }

该计划的**跟踪实体类型**是 "人"。在一个集成的 DHIS2 实例中，跟踪实体类型通常是跨程序共享的。该程序被配置为**要求用户在注册新的 TEI 之前至少搜索一个属性**。

#### 访问 { #access }

The **access** level is configured as **protected** in order to protect personally identifiable data from unauthorized access, The user may search and read tracked entity instances that are owned by the organisation unit to which the user is assigned data capture access. If a user searches for a TEI that exists outside of their organisation unit, that the user does not have data capture authority for, the user is presented with the option to access the patient record by first recording a reason. This approach to privacy is known as ‘breaking the glass’, since it allows the user to perform their work without outside permission or assistance, but leaves a clear trail to be audited. Once the user gives a reason for breaking the glass, then gain temporary ownership of the tracked entity instance (see the [Tracker User Guide](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/configuring-the-android-app/features-supported.html#breaking-the-glass) for more information.)

### 注册详情{ #enrollment-details }

**注册日期**的概念是 "肺结核诊断日期"。允许一个 TEI 有多次注册，因为病例有可能不止一次进入系统（即康复后再次成为病例）。如果一个病例之前在结核病例监测跟踪系统中登记过，则可以使用[登记小部件](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/tracking-individual-level-data/tracker-capture.html#manage_tracked_entity_instance_enrollment) 查看登记历史。

### 属性 { #attributes }

当一个病例作为被追踪实体实例（TEI）登记到结核病例监测中时，TEI 属性将被记录下来以形成病例档案。请注意，如果结核病跟踪程序与其他程序一起安装在 DHIS2 实例中，这些共同属性可能会在不同程序中共享（如名、姓、出生日期）。

### 第 1 阶段：结核病登记{ #stage-1-tb-registration }

结核病登记阶段收集基线信息、风险因素和合并症，包括艾滋病毒感染状况。这是一个不可重复的计划阶段。虽然基线阶段的大部分信息应在病例首次登记时完成，但如果有新信息（最明显的是疾病部位或 HIV 感染状况的更新），则可在登记期间的任何时候更新该阶段的信息。

结核病登记的**事件日期**是在 DHIS2 中采集（或报告）数据的日期。

肺结核注册事件在注册阶段后自动生成。

![Enrollment](resources/images/TB_CS_Enrollment.png)

数据元素 **[当前地址（地图上）]**被配置为 "坐标 "类型，以便在地图应用程序中进行地理空间分析。

数据元素 **[既往治疗史]**遵循世界卫生组织的标准定义：

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| **新** | 新患者从未接受过结核病治疗或服用抗结核药物不足 1 个月 |
| **重现** | 曾接受过治疗的患者过去曾接受过 1 个月或更长时间的抗结核药物治疗。复发患者曾接受过结核病治疗，在最近一个疗程结束时被宣布治愈或治疗结束，现在被诊断为结核病复发（真正的复发或由再次感染引起的新的结核病发作）。 |
| **一线治疗失败后的治疗** | 曾接受过治疗的患者过去曾接受过 1 个月或更长时间的抗结核药物治疗。治疗失败后患者是指曾接受过结核病治疗，但在最近一个疗程结束时治疗失败的患者。 |
| **二线治疗失败后的治疗** | 曾接受过治疗的患者过去曾接受过 1 个月或更长时间的抗结核药物治疗。治疗失败后患者是指曾接受过结核病治疗，但在最近一个疗程结束时治疗失败的患者。 |
| ** 失去随访后的治疗** | 曾接受过治疗的患者过去曾接受过 1 个月或 1 个月以上的抗结核药物治疗。失去随访机会后接受治疗的患者曾接受过结核病治疗，但在最近一个疗程结束后被宣布失去随访机会。(这些患者以前被称为失访后治疗患者。 |
| **以前接受过其他治疗** | 曾接受过治疗的患者过去曾接受过 1 个月或更长时间的抗结核药物治疗。其他曾接受过治疗的患者是指曾接受过结核病治疗，但最近一次治疗后疗效不明或无记录的患者。 |
| **未知** | 既往结核病治疗史不详的患者不属于所列的任何类别。 |

在此阶段配置了几条**程序规则**，以提高数据质量和方便数据录入。如果病例未列出 HIV 诊断，且超过 6 个月未进行检测，程序规则将显示以下警告，以提示重新检测：

![艾滋病毒再检测警告](resources/images/TB_CS_HIV_Warning.png)

### 第 2 阶段：实验室结果{ #stage-2-laboratory-results }

This stage is repeatable. Data can be entered by clinicians, facility staff, lab staff or district TB staff depending on country context. The **event date** is the ‘date of sample collection.’

同一样本采集的多个测试类型的结果可在一个事件中输入。

结核病病例监测跟踪软件包可采集 14 种诊断检测的数据。为每种检测采集的数据元素都是特定的，包括进行了哪种检测、实验室结果日期、标本编号以及是否检测到耐药性病例。DHIS2 中的 "实验室结果 "阶段可包括或不包括相关检验，这取决于执行国的国家参考实验室（NRL）是否提供这些检验。同样，表型 DST 的药物清单也可根据与该国相关的一线和二线药物进行调整。在这两种情况下，都可以在软件包的初始配置过程中通过 "常量 "进行调整。(请参阅第 [常量]（#Constants）节）。

部分测试类型的数据输入表样本如下：

![Sputum Smear Microscopy](resources/images/TB_CS_SSM.png)

![Xpert MTB/RIF](resources/images/TB_CS_Xpert.png)

![DST](resources/images/TB_CS_DST.png)

![LPA](resources/images/TB_CS_LPA.png)

在实验室阶段输入的数据用于使用程序规则计算病例和抗药性分类，这些规则也可显示在 Tracker Capture 应用程序的顶栏小部件和反馈小部件中。程序使用程序规则自动填写的数据元素，包括基于实验室结果的 DE "抗药性分类"。在 "状态 "部分，DE 还包括检测到利福平耐药性的日期，以及在多次检测的情况下 "首次检测到 "耐药性的日期。具体指标计算需要这些日期。

### 第 3 阶段：治疗{ #stage-3-treatment }

The treatment stage is a repeatable stage that should be limited to two events to account for _one_ change of treatment regimen. Program rules are used to ensure that the same regimen cannot be entered twice. The **event date** is the ‘**date of treatment initiation**’. If there is a change in treatment regimen, a second event will be recorded and the date of treatment initiated reflects the initiation of the new treatment regimen. The ‘expected date of treatment initiation’ is automatically scheduled three days from enrollment; it can be rescheduled manually.

![Treatment](resources/images/TB_CS_Treatment.png)

#### 章节：结核病耐药性类型分类{ #section-tb-drug-resistance-type-classification }

本节允许用户覆盖程序规则根据系统中的实验室结果自动生成的 DE [抗药性分类]。例如，医生/临床医师可以确定与本程序所含公式自动计算结果不同的分级状态。

![Assigning resistance classification](resources/images/TB_CS_Treatment_classification.png)

#### 部分：治疗方案{ #section-treatment-regimen }

该程序支持一线和二线治疗方案，并附有完整的药物清单，可根据国家可用性和治疗指南进行修改。常量的使用可帮助实施者启用/禁用数据录入用户的治疗方案。

#### 治疗开始日期{ #start-dates-for-treatment }

采集治疗开始日期非常重要，因为对接受二线治疗病例的疗效评估是基于开始接受二线治疗的日期；而对接受一线治疗病例的疗效评估是基于入组日期（诊断日期）。一线和二线治疗开始日期会根据计划规则自动计算，并作为数据元素纳入本阶段，以确保它们能被正确用于分析（例如，计算延迟接受治疗的天数）。

#### 成果到期日{ #outcome-due-dates }

根据治疗类型（一线或二线）和治疗开始日期，使用程序规则自动计算 DE "结果到期 "日期。当选择一种治疗方案时，"结果到期 "日期将根据该治疗方案的疗程长短进行计算和分配（对于一线治疗，结果到期日期安排在治疗开始日期的 9 个月后；对于二线治疗，结果日期安排在治疗开始日期的 24 个月后）。

![Outcome due date](resources/images/TB_CS_Outcome_due.png)

### 第 4 阶段：结果{ #stage-4-outcome }

#### 结果日期和到期日期{ #outcome-date-and-due-date }

成果阶段在入学结束时完成。该计划阶段的**事件日期**被概念化为 "结果日期"。**事件到期日**被配置为 "预期结果日期"。默认情况下，结果部分的到期日定于注册日期后 180 天"。DHIS2 2.33 版的当前功能不允许将治疗阶段的计算 DE "结果到期 "指定为结果阶段的到期日。结果阶段的到期日可以手动更改，但只能重新安排一次。对于用户来说，这可以在治疗启动和治疗阶段 "结果到期 "中的 DE 生成后进行。当结果阶段逾期时（当前日期晚于从治疗阶段计算出的 "结果到期 "日期），反馈小工具中会显示一条信息。

#### 治疗结果{ #treatment-outcome }

当选择一个结果作为选项集的一部分时，程序规则会向用户显示世界卫生组织的结果定义，以帮助确保记录正确的结果定义。这些程序规则会考虑治疗类型（一线或二线），以便显示正确的结果定义。

此外，"治愈"、"完成 "和 "未评估 "结果只能在注册日期（诊断日期）起 6 个月后输入。失败 "的治疗结果只能在注册日期（诊断日期）5 个月后输入。

![Outcome](resources/images/TB_CS_Outcome.png)

#### 结核病病例的去标识化{ #denotifying-a-tb-case }

This stage also allows a user to ‘denotify’ the TB case. For example, if laboratory results for a clinically diagnosed TB case are negative, a user may denotify the case because it is not TB. The denotification can also be used if a duplicate case is found in the system. When the ‘Denotify case’ DE is checked, the user is prompted to select a reason for denotifying from the option set and provide additional evidence for denotification or provide duplicate TB record number in case of duplication. **_When a case has been denotified for any reason, the case is excluded from analysis of TB cases._**

#### 完成成果阶段{ #completing-outcome-stage }

由程序规则触发的治疗结果旁边会出现提示**选择结果或指定此病例是否为肺结核病例**。用户不可能在未指定结果或不指定病例的情况下完成 "结果 "阶段。结果 "阶段配置为在该阶段完成后阻止数据输入。

![Completing outcome stage](resources/images/TB_CS_Complete_outcome.png)

### 计划规则{ #program-rules }

Program rules are used extensively in the TB Case Surveillance Program to show/hide data elements to optimize the data entry form, show warnings/feedback to the data entry user and autocalculate & assign data values to data elements. Selected program rules for understanding the configuration of this program for TB Case Surveillance are described below. A complete list of program rules can be found in the Metadata Reference File.

#### 限制治疗次数{ #limit-number-of-treatment-events }

对于肺结核病例监测，治疗方案的每次改变（如从一线改为二线）只能捕获一个治疗事件。程序规则用于将事件数量限制为一种治疗方案的改变。为确保同一治疗方案不能输入两次，一个有一线治疗方案的事件只允许在第二个事件中选择二线治疗方案，反之亦然。

#### 限制结果选项和显示结果定义{ #limit-outcome-options-and-show-outcome-definitions }

在结果阶段，程序规则被配置为 "显示警告"，根据提供的是一线治疗还是二线治疗，向数据输入用户提供世界卫生组织的病例结果定义。

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| **成果** | **治愈** |
| 定义（一线治疗） | 开始治疗时经细菌学确诊为肺结核的患者，在治疗的最后一个月及之前至少有一次涂片或培养阴性。 |
| 定义（二线治疗） | 按照国家政策的建议完成治疗，没有失败的证据，并且在强化阶段后至少间隔 30 天连续进行三次或三次以上培养均为阴性。对于治疗失败，强化阶段结束时仍未转阴意味着患者在方案规定的强化阶段最长持续时间内未转阴。如果没有规定最长持续时间，则建议以 8 个月为分界线。对于强化阶段和延续阶段没有明确区分的治疗方案，建议以治疗开始后 8 个月为分界线，以确定治愈、治疗完成和治疗失败的标准何时开始适用。 |
| 计划规则 | 1.选项不适用于注册后 6 个月内记录的结果。2.选项不适用于临床诊断的病例。3.选项不适用于正在接受二线治疗的肺外结核病例（显示错误信息）。 |
| **成果** | **已完成** |
| 定义（一线治疗） | 肺结核病人完成了治疗，但没有证据表明治疗失败，但没有记录表明在治疗的最后一个月以及之前至少一次的痰涂片或培养结果为阴性，原因是没有进行检测或无法获得结果。 |
| 定义（二线治疗） | 按照国家政策的建议完成治疗，没有失败的证据 BUT 在强化阶段结束后，没有记录表明至少相隔 30 天连续进行的三次或三次以上培养结果均为阴性。对于治疗失败，强化阶段结束时仍未转阴意味着患者在方案规定的强化阶段最长持续时间内未转阴。如果没有规定最长持续时间，则建议以 8 个月为分界线。对于强化阶段和延续阶段没有明确区分的治疗方案，建议以治疗开始后 8 个月为分界线，以确定治愈、治疗完成和治疗失败的标准何时开始适用。 |
| 计划规则 | 选项不适用于注册后 6 个月内记录的结果。 |
| **成果** | **失败** |
| 定义（一线治疗） | 在治疗过程中，痰涂片或培养在第 5 个月或以后呈阳性的肺结核患者。 |
| 定义（二线治疗） | Treatment terminated or need for permanent regimen change of at least two anti-TB drugs because of: lack of conversion by the end of the intensive phase, or bacteriological reversion in the continuation phase after conversion to negative, or evidence of additional acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones or second-line injectable drugs, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For Treatment failed, lack of conversion by the end of the intensive phase implies that the patient does not convert within the maximum duration of intensive phase applied by the programme. If no maximum duration is defined, an 8-month cut-off is proposed. For regimens without a clear distinction between intensive and continuation phases, a cut-off 8 months after the start of treatment is suggested to determine when the criteria for Cured, Treatment completed and Treatment failed start to apply. The terms “conversion” and “reversion” of culture as used here are defined as follows: Conversion (to negative): culture is considered to have converted to negative when two consecutive cultures, taken at least 30 days apart, are found to be negative. In such a case, the specimen collection date of the first negative culture is used as the date of conversion. Reversion (to positive): culture is considered to have reverted to positive when, after an initial conversion, two consecutive cultures, taken at least 30 days apart, are found to be positive. For the purpose of defining Treatment failed, reversion is considered only when it occurs in the continuation phase. |
| 计划规则 | Option is not available for outcomes that are recorded within the period of 5 months after enrollment. |
| **Outcome** | **Died** |
| Definition (First-line Treatment) | A TB patient who dies for any reason before starting or during the course of treatment. |
| Definition (Second-line Treatment) | A patient who dies for any reason during the course of treatment. |
| 计划规则 | -/- |
| **Outcome** | **Lost to follow-up** |
| Definition (First-line Treatment) | A TB patient who did not start treatment or whose treatment was interrupted for 2 consecutive months or more. |
| Definition (Second-line Treatment) | A patient whose treatment was interrupted for 2 consecutive months or more. |
| 计划规则 | -/- |
| **Outcome** | **Not evaluated** |
| Definition (First-line Treatment) | A TB patient for whom no treatment outcome is assigned. This includes cases “transferred out” to another treatment unit as well as cases for whom the treatment outcome is unknown to the reporting unit. |
| Definition (Second-line Treatment) | A patient for whom no treatment outcome is assigned. (This includes cases “transferred out” to another treatment unit and whose treatment outcome is unknown). |
| 计划规则 | Option is not available for outcomes that are recorded within the period of 6 months after enrollment. |

#### Auto-assigned data element values { #auto-assigned-data-element-values }

Data values (options within an option set) are automatically assigned to the data elements Case Classification and Resistance Classification when data is entered in the laboratory stage. These classification data elements are also displayed in the top bar as part of the TEI dashboard for easy access when a user has the data entry forms open for a given TEI in theTracker Capture app.

**_Case Classification (DE)_**

This data element is automatically populated by program rules based on the following criteria. The Case Classification is assigned a value as ‘clinically diagnosed’ until lab data are entered upon enrollment in the program.

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| Clinically diagnosed | Default classification status when enrolling a case in TB Case Surveillance. |
| Bacteriologically confirmed | If Laboratory Results are entered in DHIS2 for the following types of tests: _Positive results for Sputum Smear Microscopy or Culture_; _MTB/Drug Resistance detected by WHO Rapid Diagnostic Tests or LPA_. The program does not prevent users from entering DST results prior to entering results of preceding tests in the Lab stage. Entering **only** DST results does not change the confirmation method from “Clinically diagnosed” to “Bacteriologically confirmed” since DST testing is dependent on Culture. |

**_Resistance Classification (DE)_**

This data element is automatically populated by program rules based on the following criteria. However, in practice a data entry user can manually change the classification (e.g. if a doctor/clinician has determined the case is DR).

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| DS (Drug susceptible) | Default classification when enrolling a case in TB Case Surveillance. The Classification is automatically assigned the option ‘DS (drug susceptible)’ until additional lab data are entered. |
| DR (Drug resistant) | Resistance to any drug |
| Mono Res (Mono-resistant) | Resistance to one first-line anti-TB drug only |
| Poly Res (Poly-resistant) | Resistance to more than one first-line anti-TB drug, other than both isoniazid and rifampicin |
| RR (Rifampicin resistant) | Resistance to rifampicin detected using phenotypic or genotypic methods, with or without resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It includes any resistance to rifampicin, in the form of mono-resistance, poly-resistance, MDR or XDR. |
| MDR (Multidrug resistant) | Resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampicin |
| XDR (Extensive drug resistant) | Extensive drug resistance (XDR): resistance to any fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, and one second-line injectable drug (amikacin), in addition to multidrug resistance |
| RR/MDR | Not-laboratory confirmed cases that began on second-line treatment (More information in the Treatment section). |

**_Treatment Initiation & Outcome Due Dates_**

Program rules are used to assign the event date of the Treatment Program stage as DEs for ‘First-line treatment start’ and ‘Second-line treatment start.’ In addition, a DE ‘Expected date of outcome’ is completed by a program rule and included in both the Treatment and Outcome stages. For first-line treatment, the expected outcome date is 9 months from treatment initiation date. For second-line treatment, the expected outcome date is 24 months from treatment initiation. The dates are also used for analysis. For example, the number of days delay in treatment is calculated based on the time between diagnosis and initiation of treatment.

#### Illustrative Scenarios { #illustrative-scenarios }

In the context of TB Case Surveillance, combinations of program rules apply the following to difference case scenarios:

|  |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **No laboratory results or treatment for the case has been recorded** | Available outcomes in the Outcome stage: died, lost to follow up. | If the case is not TB, it is possible to “denotify” the case in the Outcome stage. This will remove the case from analytics processes. |
| **No laboratory results have been recorded.** The case is placed on first-line treatment and no previous treatment event has been registered. | First-line treatment start date is recorded in the status section. An expected date of treatment outcome (9 months from treatment initiation date) is also displayed in the Status section in the Treatment stage. | When adding a second Treatment event, the user will be prevented from selecting first-line treatment in the treatment regimen. |
| **Laboratory results have been recorded and drug resistance has been detected.** The case is placed on first-line Treatment and no previous treatment event has been registered. | First-line treatment start date is recorded in the status section. An expected date of treatment outcome (9 months from treatment initiation date) is also displayed in the status section. A warning message is displayed in the Feedback Widget: _**Drug resistance detected and patient is on first-line treatment.**_ | When adding a second Treatment event, the user will be prevented from selecting First-line treatment in the treatment regimen. |
| **No laboratory results have been recorded and no previous treatment recorded, but the case is placed on second-line treatment** | The case is registered as a clinically diagnosed RR/MDR case. Second-line treatment start date is recorded in the status section. Expected date of treatment outcome (24 months from treatment initiation date) is displayed in the status section. | Once laboratory results are entered in the Laboratory Results stage the classification is automatically reassigned by the system. When adding a second Treatment event, the user is prevented from selecting Second-line treatment in the treatment regimen. |
| **Laboratory results have been recorded in DHIS2 and drug resistance has been detected.** No previous treatment event is registered. The case is placed on second-line treatment | Second-line treatment start date is recorded in the status section. Expected date of treatment outcome (24 months from treatment initiation date) is displayed in the status section. | When adding a second Treatment event, the user will be prevented from selecting Second-line treatment in the treatment regimen. |
| **No laboratory results have been recorded in DHIS2.** Previous treatment event was first-line treatment. The case is placed on second-line treatment. | Second-line treatment start date is recorded in the status section. Expected date of treatment outcome (24 months from treatment initiation date) is displayed in the status section. | It is not possible to create new Treatment events. |
| **Laboratory results have been recorded in DHIS2 and drug resistance has been detected.** Previous treatment event was First-line Treatment. The case is placed on Second-line Treatment. | Second-line treatment start date is recorded in the status section. Expected date of treatment outcome (24 months from treatment initiation date) is displayed in the status section. | It is not possible to create new Treatment events. |

### Top Bar Widget { #top-bar-widget }

The top bar widget within the Tracker Capture app is useful for the data entry user to have a snapshot overview of information about the TEI (case) every time the TEI enrollment is opened for this program.

The table below summarizes program indicators and variables displayed in the Top Bar Widget and how they are calculated. “Type” refers to whether a particular variable is configured as a program indicator with the “display in form” option enabled, or if it is calculated and displayed using program rules.

| 变量 | 类型 | Calculation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Current age (years) | 计划指标 | Number of years between current date and the “Date of birth (age)” tracked entity attribute. |
| Months since enrolment | 计划指标 | Number of months from enrolment in the program (notification date) to the current date. |
| Treatment regimen | Program rule | Showing the current (latest) treatment regimen recorded (initial first-line, retreatment first-line, second line) |
| Case classification | Program rule | If no positive culture, smear or Xpert MTB result is recorded in the lab stage, the classification is “clinically diagnosed”. If a positive result is recorded for any of the tests, the classification is “Bacteriologically confirmed”. |
| Resistance classification | Program rule | Based on Xpert RIF results and any resistance results from the DST program stage, the case is classified as drug susceptible (DS), or with different types of drug resistance (DR, RR, MDR, XDR). The case is classified as a “Non-lab confirmed DR” case if this is selected on the treatment page AND no drug resistance results are recorded. |
| Resistance | Program rule | Lists the drugs for which drug resistance have been detected through Xpert RIF or DST testing. |

### Feedback Widget { #feedback-widget }

The following feedback messages are configured to display in the Feedback Widget when certain conditions are met as outlined in the table below:

| 信息 | Condition |
| :-- | :-- |
| Drug resistance detected and the patient is on first-line treatment. | Patient is on first-line treatment, despite having lab/DST results indicating drug resistance. |
| GeneXpert MTB not detected. This may not be a TB case. | Xpert MTB results are “Not detected”, which indicate that this is not a TB case |
| No drug resistance detected, but patient is on second-line treatment. | Patient is on second-line treatment, without lab/DST results indicating drug resistance. |
| Only two treatment events can be added. | User adds a third treatment event. Only two are supported, to account for initial treatment regimen, and one change in regimen. |
| Outcome is overdue. | If the current date is later than the calculated DE ‘Outcome due’ in the treatment section, then the message appears in the feedback widget. |
| Please immediately complete the treatment outcome. | The “Not TB” checkbox is completed, indicating that a case is not TB and the enrollment should be closed. |
| Positive smear result recorded. Review the reported "Site of disease". | A positive smear result has been recorded, but the value entered for “Site of disease” does not include “Pulmonary”. |

## Additional features { #additional-features }

### 常数 { #constants }

TB Case Surveillance Tracker package includes a set of tests and a list of drugs that can be modified by the implementing country according to national context (e.g. which drugs and tests are used/available in country). The use of constants enables a system admin in an implementing country to easily ‘turn on’ or ‘turn off’ types of drugs and tests depending on availability in country. When the complete package is installed into a DHIS2 instance, all data elements for all tests and drugs included in this package are included in the system. By default, all constants are set to ‘1’ (enabling the related data elements for data entry) and can be configured to ‘2’ by an implementer or system admin according to country context if not needed (disabling the related data elements for data entry). If a test or drug later becomes available in the country, an admin can simply re-enable the data elements by changing the constant from a value of ‘2’ to a value of ‘1’.

### Reporting case-based data into aggregate TB reports { #reporting-case-based-data-into-aggregate-tb-reports }

The TB case-based surveillance tracker captures data that can be fed into standard, aggregate reporting (i.e. monthly, quarterly, or more frequently as determined by the country). An aggregate TB system design in DHIS2 can be accessed at [who.dhis2.org/documentation/#tb](https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/#tb).

The package includes a set of program indicators that are mapped to the corresponding data elements and category option combinations of the data sets in the TB aggregate package. The mapping is based on codes of metadata objects.

The custom attribute **Data element for aggregate data export** `vudyDP7jUy5` contains the reference code of the aggregate data elements. The **Category option combination for agggregate export** field contains reference codes of the category option combinations.

The suggested transfer of the tracker-to-aggregate values is based on the following GET and POST API requests:

1. Source request: `../api/analytics/dataValueSet.json?dimension=dx:` "{program indicator uid/s}" `&dimension=pe:` "{relative period/s}" `&dimension=ou:` {organisation unit level} `&outputIdScheme=ATTRIBUTE:` {"custom attribute:`vudyDP7jUy5`"}
2. Target request: `..api/dataValueSets?dataElementIdScheme=CODE&categoryOptionComboIdScheme=CODE&importStrategy=CREATE_AND_UPDATE&mergeMode=REPLACE&dryRun=false`

In addition, the package comes with a set of indicators that can be fed into a GTB Report form.

### 仪表板 { #dashboard }

A subset of data visualizations from the WHO Aggregate TB Package have been recreated using program indicators. These visualizations display data from the Tracker program. These visualizations were selected by WHO as the most useful for monitoring at a facility level more frequently, e.g. in between submitting monthly/quarterly aggregate reports to the HMIS. These visualizations may also support the facility or district level user to compare the TB case surveillance data captured in the Tracker Program with the aggregated data submitted to the HMIS.

## User Groups { #user-groups }

The following user groups are included in the TB Case Surveillance Tracker Package:

-   TB Admin: can edit/view metadata; no access to data [all program stages]
-   TB Data capture: can view metadata, can capture data [all program stages]
-   TB Access: cam view metadata, can view data [all program stages]
-   TB Lab data capture: can view metadata, can capture data [TB registration stage and Laboratory stage only]
