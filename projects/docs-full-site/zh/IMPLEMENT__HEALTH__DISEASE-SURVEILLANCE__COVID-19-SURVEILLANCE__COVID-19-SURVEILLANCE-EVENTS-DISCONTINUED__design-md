# COVID-19 Surveillance Line-list Design { #c19-evt-design }

Demo: [https://covid.dhis2.org](https://covid.dhis2.org/demo)

## 目的 { #purpose } 

The COVID-19 Surveillance Event Program System Design document provides an overview of the design principles and guidance used to develop the digital data package for aggregate COVID-19 surveillance. This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localisation of the package. The COVID-19 metadata package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines. In particular, local work flows and national guidelines should be considered in the localization and adoption of the programs included in this package.

## 背景 { #background } 

The COVID-19 digital data package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing COVID-19 data. UiO has developed COVID-19 surveillance packages for three types of data models (tracker, event-based aggregate) to enable countries to select the model that is most appropriate for their context given the burden of disease and available resources. These models and their relative benefits/limitations are summarized below:

|监控套餐类型|基于案例的监视（跟踪器）|监视（事件）|监视（总计）|
|--|--|--|--|
|_Description_|Enrolls a case and tracks over time through laboratory confirmation & case outcome|以行列表格式捕获关键案例详细信息|启用每日或每周的关键汇总数据点报告|
|_Pros_|高度精细的数据和用于分析的多个时间维度，可以支持分散的工作流，所有事件都与案例相关|比汇总更精细，可以捕获关键的时间维度（即报告日期与症状发作）；与跟踪器相比，减少了数据输入的负担，并且几乎没有复杂性|低复杂度，易于实施，在案件数量高时最易于管理|
|_Cons_|当案件数达到阈值时，数据输入的负担可能会不堪重负；实施的复杂性|不支持个案跟进或其他分散式工作流程|进行详细分析的粒度较小（即仅根据病例报告日期进行分析，分类范围有限）

**This document covers only the design of the surveillance event program package**; separate system design documents are available for DHIS2 Tracker and aggregate packages.

世卫组织“敦促所有国家通过准备应急系统来为COVID-19的潜在到来做准备；提高发现和照顾病人的能力；确保医院有足够的空间，物资和必要的人员；并开发挽救生命的医疗干预措施。”

COVID-19监视的目标是：

1. 监测发生人际传播的疾病趋势；
2. 在病毒未传播的国家中迅速发现新病例；
3. 提供流行病学信息以在国家，区域和全球范围内进行风险评估；和
4. 提供流行病学信息以指导准备和应对措施。

The system design builds upon existing disease surveillance principles and information system requirements that have been developed collaboratively between the WHO and UiO since 2017. The COVID-19 package was developed with the intent to align to [WHO technical guidance on nCoV-19 surveillance and case definitions](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions), last updated March 20, 2020. Note that this design may not necessarily reflect the latest available interim global guidance developed by WHO as updates may be released rapidly. National guidelines and policies may vary and it is recommended to adapt this package to local context.

## 系统设计摘要 { #system-design-summary } 

This package is designed as a DHIS2 [Event Program](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/configuring-the-system/programs.html#about_event_program). **The Event Program is not designed to capture all data variables contained in the [WHO case reporting template](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/2020-02-27-data-dictionary-en.xlsx)**. To capture a complete set of WHO case reporting variables, please refer to the DHIS2 COVID-19 Case-based Surveillance Tracker. Rather, the event program is a simplified program that captures a subset of minimum critical data points to facilitate high data quality when the number of caseloads or burden of reporting exceeds capacity for successfully completing the full line-list for suspected COVID-19 cases. For implementers who wish to capture the complete WHO line-listing, please refer to the COVID-19 Case-based Surveillance Tracker Package.

The COVID-19 Surveillance Event Program data package includes:

1. Event program and data elements case reporting
2. Core indicators
3. 仪表板

### Use Case: Simplified line-listing of COVID-19 cases { #use-case-simplified-line-listing-of-covid-19-cases } 

As cases increase rapidly, some countries may struggle with case-based reporting as the burden becomes too high. The event package is designed to capture the most critical data points in a line-list and analytical capacities for surveillance and response. The event package is designed as a standalone program. However, countries may use the event package in combination with other packages (i.e. event reports and daily aggregate reporting); or, they may shift from tracker to event to aggregate as caseloads and reporting burden increases. **_Countries should plan carefully how they intend to implement these packages in combination, including reporting flows, transitioning from one data model to another, and how to maintain historical data for analysis if transitioning between data models.   _**

The design of the event-based line-listing program assumes that [WHO case definitions](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331506/WHO-2019-nCoV-SurveillanceGuidance-2020.6-eng.pdf) are followed in the use case; countries should follow national case definitions for classifying cases as suspected, probably or confirmed.

#### 目标用户 { #intended-users } 

* Health facility users: capture and report key data on COVID-19 cases and deaths presenting at the health facility
* 国家和地方卫生当局：通过仪表板和分析工具监测和分析疾病监测数据，以进行风险评估和计划应对措施；生成区域和全球报告的报告

#### 工作流程 { #workflow } 

Unlike the tracker program, there are limitations to decentralization of the data reporting workflow in an Event program. The most significant limitation is that the Case Outcome (recovery or death) is often not known until days or weeks after the case is reported. The current program design allows for the following workflow options:

1. Event is created when a suspected case is reported. All known data is entered, but the event is not completed. A user can select an ‘Active Event’ from a working list based on User filters and criteria. When missing data becomes available (i.e. the case outcome), the user can enter the remaining data fields and complete the event. Cases can be identified in the event list by the Case ID data element. See the image below as an example which can be accessed within the Capture App:
![Capture App](resources/images/EVENT_image1.png "Capture App")

2. Event is created. All case related data is entered retrospectively, including the Outcome. Event is completed. _The limitation is this approach is timeliness of the data reporting, as new suspected cases might not be captured until their outcome which is often too late for decision making._

### Program Structure { #program-structure } 

The program is called ‘COVID-19 Cases (events)’

|Section|描述|
|--|--|
|Date of report|Event Date<br>_Countries may re-name the event date to apply to their protocols._|
|Section 1<br>**Basic Information**|Records basic demographic data.<br>_Countries may add data elements as desired._<br>- **Patient ID**<br>Can be used to filter events in working lists, eg. Active events<br>- **Sex**<br>- **Age**|
|Section 2<br>Case Details|Records information about the case including symptoms, severity, testing, etc.<br>- **Symptoms**<br>Options: Yes / No<br>Specifies whether a case has any symptoms at time of notification <br><br> - **Date of symptoms onset**<br>Only appears if symptoms are present;<br>Date of symptoms onset, if available, will replace “Date of Report” in data analytics and reporting. <br><br> - **Case Severity (at time of notification)**<br>Options: Mild / Moderate / Severe / Critical<br>- **Laboratory tested?**<br>Options: Yes / No/ Unknown<br>Specifies whether a case has been laboratory tested for COVID-19 <br><br> - **Test Result**<br>Only appears if the case was laboratory tested<br>Options: Inconclusive / Positive / Negative / Unknown<br>The program is designed to capture only the final test result. Results for each individual test (if available) and the total number of tests performed are not captured.<br>- **Case Classification**<br>Options: Suspected case / Probable case / Laboratory confirmed case<br>Automatically assigned values<br>The values are assigned by Program rules in accordance with WHO case definitions<br>This feature can be useful in filtering active cases in the working lists.|
|Section 3<br>**Exposures**|- **Has the case traveled in the 14 days prior to symptoms onset?**<br>Options: Yes / No / Unknown<br>Specifies travel history of the case. <br><br> - **Likely Infection Source**<br>Options: Imported case* / Local Transmission / Exposure unknown<br>* Imported case option appears only if the case traveled in the 14 days prior to symptoms onset <br><br> - **Specify local source**<br>Only appears if Likely Infection Source is Local Transmission<br>Options: Community (workplace, public transport, etc.) / Household / Healthcare Facility / Close Contact with Other Infected Individual / Exposure Unknown <br><br> - **Case Type**<br>Options: New index case / Linked to existing cluster / Unknown<br>Specifies whether the case is connected to an existing cluster or is a new index case|
|Section 4<br>**Treatment**|- **Hospitalised**<br>Options: Yes / No<br><br>- **Did the case receive care in an intensive care unit (ICU)?**<br>Only appears if the case is hospitalised<br>Options: Yes / No|
|Section 5<br>**Contacts**|- **Total number of contacts followed for this case**<br>Records number of contacts|
|Section 6<br>**Outcome**|- **Health outcome**<br>Options: Recovered / Death|
|Section 7<br>**Assigned Date of onset of symptoms**|- **Calculated onset date (for Indicators)**<br>This section is used only to calculate indicators based on report date vs. date of onset of symptoms]<br>This automatically assigned date is used in program indicators. Initially, it is the report date. If the date of onset of symptoms is available, the date is replaced by the date of onset of symptoms.|
|**Status**|**This is a generic field included in all Event Program**<br>**Complete event**<br>Option: Yes<br>The event should only be marked as ‘complete’ if all data entry has been completed. If the user is waiting to complete certain fields (such as case outcome), the event should be left not complete.<br>Events that are not marked as ‘Complete’ are maintained as active and can be more easily searched by the user in a working list|
|Section 9<br>**Comments**|- **Comments**<br>Optional comments and remarks. Note that these comments will not display in the analytics and can only be accessed through the Capture app used to enter line-listed data.|

### User Groups { #user-groups } 

The following user groups are included in the metadata package:

1. COVID19 admin -- intended for system admins to have metadata edit rights
2. COVID19 data capture -- intended for data entry staff to have access to capture data
3. COVID19 access -- intended for users such as analytics users who should be able to view the data, but not edit metadata. 

Currently, only users assigned to the COVID19 data capture group will have access to capture data in the program.  Please refer to the installation guidance for more instructions.

### Program Rules { #program-rules } 

The following program rules have been configured for the program:

|程序规则名称|程序规则说明|

### Indicators and Program Indicators { #indicators-and-program-indicators } 

From the data captured in the COVID-19 line-listing program, we can calculate the following indicators, including those recommended by the WHO for daily and weekly reporting, present them in a dashboard. All COVID-19 program indicators based on the event program are assigned to the Program Indicator Group ‘COVID-19 Events.’
