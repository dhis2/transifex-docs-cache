# CH - Child Health { #ch-cdh-aggregate-design }

## 1.Datasets { #1datasets }

### 1.1. Configuration Summary { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - Child Health (ChH) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for child health
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on child health
3. Des **Indicateurs de base** pour les deux ensembles de données
4. A predefined **“CH - Child Health” dashboard**

Il est recommandé que les ensembles de données soient attribués aux unités d'organisation **au niveau le plus bas** possible du système de santé pour la déclaration des données, telles que les villages ou toute démarcation communautaire appropriée en fonction du contexte local.

## 1.2. Data Elements { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the ChH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the ChH module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details { #2-dataset-details }

### 2.1. Monthly Child Health Dataset { #21-monthly-child-health-dataset }

The [United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/gb/reports/humanitarian/uncrc19-summary2.pdf) defines a child as every human being **below the age of 18 years**, unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier. **This module focuses more specifically on children between the age of 29 days and 9 years**. In both the monthly and the yearly datasets the category combinations for the age groups have age groups that go beyond the definition. This has been done to avoid creating _ad hoc_ age groups for each and every dataset. The age groups above the definition of Child have been greyed-out and therefore blocked for data entry. Countries should nonetheless edit and apply the age categories that better reflect the local context and guidelines.

#### 2.1.1. Infant Feeding { #211-infant-feeding }

The section is set to collect the number of CHWs consultations to infants and about appropriate feeding.

The second part of the section divides the reached people by type of preventive chemotherapy (Albendazole and Mebendazole).

## 5. Dashboards { #5-dashboards }

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Child Health”. The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

La première partie concerne les indicateurs mensuels. Les éléments prédéfinis permettent d'analyser et de visualiser les principales composantes de l'ensemble de données, bien que le tableau de bord doive être modifié pour mieux refléter les activités locales.

La deuxième partie du tableau de bord est dédiée à l'ensemble de données annuel (Indicateurs d'évaluation annuels des ménages). Les éléments prédéfinis permettent d'analyser et de visualiser les principales composantes de l'ensemble de données, bien que le tableau de bord doive être modifié pour mieux refléter les activités locales.
