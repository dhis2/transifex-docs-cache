# Event Reports - Session Summary { #event-reports-session-summary } 

The Event Reports app enables analysis of events in two ways:
1. Pivot table-style analysis with aggregated values of events
2. Lists of events based on queries / filters

There are two table styles in event reports:
1. Pivot : allows us to create aggregate tables based on tracker or event data
2. Line List : allows us to create line lists based on tracker or event data

Along with two output types:
1. Event :  shows data from all events within a single program stage we are working with (including repeated events)
2. Enrollment :  shows data from the most recent event; can combine data across all program stages

We can only show data from multiple stages using the combination of a line list table and an enrollment output type.
