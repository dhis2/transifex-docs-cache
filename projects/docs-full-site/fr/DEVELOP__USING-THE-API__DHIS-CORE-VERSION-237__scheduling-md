# Programmation { #webapi_scheduling } 

DHIS2 allows for scheduling of jobs of various types. Each type of job has different properties for configuration, giving you finer control over how jobs are run. In addition, you can configure the same job to run with different configurations and at different intervals if required.



Table: Main properties

| Propriété | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| nom | Name of the job. | Chaîne |
| cronExpression | The cron expression which defines the interval for when the job should run. | String (Cron expression) |
| jobType | The job type represent which task is run. In the next table, you can get an overview of existing job types. Each job type can have a specific set of parameters for job configuration. | String (Enum) |
| jobParameters | Job parameters, if applicable for job type. | (See list of job types) |
| enabled | A job can be added to the system without it being scheduled by setting `enabled` to false in the JSON payload. Use this if you want to temporarily stop scheduling for a job, or if a job configuration is not complete yet. | Booléen |

### Get available job types { #get-available-job-types } 

To get a list of all available job types you can use the following endpoint:

    GET /api/jobConfigurations/jobTypes

The response contains information about each job type including name, job type, key, scheduling type and available parameters. The scheduling type can either be `CRON`, meaning jobs can be scheduled using a cron expression with the `cronExpression` field, or `FIXED_DELAY`, meaning jobs can be scheduled to run with a fixed delay in between with the `delay` field. The field delay is given in seconds.

A response will look similar to this:

```json
{
  "jobTypes": [
    {
      "name": "Data integrity",
      "jobType": "DATA_INTEGRITY",
      "key": "dataIntegrityJob",
      "schedulingType": "CRON"
    }, {
      "name": "Resource table",
      "jobType": "RESOURCE_TABLE",
      "key": "resourceTableJob",
      "schedulingType": "CRON"
    }, {
      "name": "Continuous analytics table",
      "jobType": "CONTINUOUS_ANALYTICS_TABLE",
      "key": "continuousAnalyticsTableJob",
      "schedulingType": "FIXED_DELAY"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create job { #create-job } 

To configure jobs you can do a POST request to the following resource:

    /api/jobConfigurations

A job without parameters in JSON format looks like this :

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "jobType": "JOBTYPE",
  "cronExpression": "0 * * ? * *",
}
```

An example of an analytics table job with parameters in JSON format:

```json
{
  "name": "Analytics tables last two years",
  "jobType": "ANALYTICS_TABLE",
  "cronExpression": "0 * * ? * *",
  "jobParameters": {
    "lastYears": "2",
    "skipTableTypes": [],
    "skipResourceTables": false
  }
}
```

As example of a push analysis job with parameters in JSON format:

```json
{
   "name": "Push anlysis charts",
   "jobType": "PUSH_ANALYSIS",
   "cronExpression": "0 * * ? * *",
   "jobParameters": {
     "pushAnalysis": [
       "jtcMAKhWwnc"
     ]
    }
 }
```

An example of a job with scheduling type `FIXED_DELAY` and 120 seconds delay:

```json
{
  "name": "Continuous analytics table",
  "jobType": "CONTINUOUS_ANALYTICS_TABLE",
  "delay": "120",
  "jobParameters": {
    "fullUpdateHourOfDay": 4
  }
}
```

### Get jobs { #get-jobs } 

List all job configurations:

    GET /api/jobConfigurations

Retrieve a job:

    GET /api/jobConfigurations/{id}

The response payload looks like this:

```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "2018-02-22T15:15:34.067",
  "id": "KBcP6Qw37gT",
  "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/jobConfigurations/KBcP6Qw37gT",
  "created": "2018-02-22T15:15:34.067",
  "name": "analytics last two years",
  "jobStatus": "SCHEDULED",
  "displayName": "analytics last two years",
  "enabled": true,
  "externalAccess": false,
  "jobType": "ANALYTICS_TABLE",
  "nextExecutionTime": "2018-02-26T03:00:00.000",
  "cronExpression": "0 0 3 ? * MON",
  "jobParameters": {
    "lastYears": 2,
    "skipTableTypes": [],
    "skipResourceTables": false
  },
  "favorite": false,
  "configurable": true,
  "access": {
    "read": true,
    "update": true,
    "externalize": true,
    "delete": true,
    "write": true,
    "manage": true
  },
  "lastUpdatedBy": {
    "id": "GOLswS44mh8"
  },
  "favorites": [],
  "translations": [],
  "userGroupAccesses": [],
  "attributeValues": [],
  "userAccesses": []
}
```

### Update job { #update-job } 

Update a job with parameters using the following endpoint and JSON payload format:

    PUT /api/jobConfiguration/{id}

```json
{
  "name": "analytics last two years",
  "enabled": true,
  "cronExpression": "0 0 3 ? * MON",
  "jobType": "ANALYTICS_TABLE",
  "jobParameters": {
    "lastYears": "3",
    "skipTableTypes": [],
    "skipResourceTables": false
  }
}
```

### Delete job { #delete-job } 

Delete a job using:

    DELETE /api/jobConfiguration/{id}

Note that some jobs with custom configuration parameters may not be added if the
required system settings are not configured. An example of this is data
synchronization, which requires remote server configuration.

## Synchronization { #webapi_synchronization } 

This section covers pull and push of data and metadata.

### Data value push { #webapi_sync_data_push } 

To initiate a data value push to a remote server one must first configure the
URL and credentials for the relevant server from System settings >
Synchronization, then make a POST request to the following resource:

    /api/33/synchronization/dataPush

### Metadata pull { #webapi_sync_metadata_pull } 

To initiate a metadata pull from a remote JSON document you can make a
POST request with a *url* as request payload to the following resource:

    /api/33/synchronization/metadataPull

### Availability check { #webapi_sync_availability_check } 

To check the availability of the remote data server and verify user
credentials you can make a GET request to the following resource:

    /api/33/synchronization/availability
