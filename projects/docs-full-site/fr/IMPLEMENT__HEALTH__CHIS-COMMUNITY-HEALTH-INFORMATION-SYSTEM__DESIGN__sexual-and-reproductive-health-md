# CHIS - Sexual and Reproductive Health { #chis-agg-srh-design }

## 1. Ensembles de données { #1-datasets }

### 1.1. Résumé de la configuration { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements
2. A y**early dataset** for the follow up of key annual information
3. Des **Indicateurs de base** pour les deux ensembles de données
4. A predefined **“CH - Sexual and reproductive health” dashboard**

Il est recommandé que les ensembles de données soient attribués aux unités d'organisation **au niveau le plus bas** possible du système de santé pour la déclaration des données, telles que les villages ou toute démarcation communautaire appropriée en fonction du contexte local.

### 1.2. Éléments de données { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the SRH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the SRH module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details { #2-dataset-details } 

In both the monthly and the yearly datasets the category combinations for the age groups have age groups that go beyond the [WHO definition of adolescents](https://www.who.int/southeastasia/health-topics/adolescent-health) “WHO defines '**Adolescents**' as individuals **in the 10-19 years age group** and '**Youth**' as **the 15-24 year age group**. While 'Young People' covers the age range 10-24 years” . This has been done to avoid creating *ad hoc* age groups for each and every dataset. The age groups above the definition of Adolescent/Youth have been greyed-out and therefore blocked for data entry. Countries should nonetheless edit and apply the age categories that better reflect the local context and guidelines.

### 2.1. Monthly SRH Dataset { #21-monthly-srh-dataset } 

#### 2.1.1. Planning familial { #211-family-planning }

The section summarizes the uptake of modern family planning methods. The data is disaggregated by age (10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age) and methods (Pill, Condom, Injectable, Emergency contraception, vaginal barrier, LAM, Other FP method). The methods should be adapted to the local context.

![Family Planning](resources/images/chis-srh-m-001.png)

#### 2.1.2. Family Planning and HIV { #212-family-planning-and-hiv } 

The section collects data on adolescent routine HIV testing and on the uptake of modern FP methods. The former is disaggregated by age group (10-14y and 15-19y as per definition of adolescent) and by result of the test (positive, negative, indeterminate); while the latter is by age groups (10-14y and 15-19y as per definition of adolescent).

![Family planning & HIV](resources/images/chis-srh-m-002.png)

#### 2.1.3. Urethral Discharge { #213-urethral-discharge } 

The section collects data on men presenting with urethral discharge and on the number of referrals. The data is disaggregated by age groups (10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age).

![Urethral Discharge](resources/images/chis-srh-m-003.png)

#### 2.1.4. Syphilis Screening { #214-syphilis-screening } 

The section monitors women through their ANC appointments. The data is disaggregated by age groups (10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age).

![Syphilis Screening](resources/images/chis-srh-m-004.png)

#### 2.1.5. Abortion Care and Services { #215-abortion-care-and-services } 

The section captures the accessibility and the use of safe abortion care. The data is disaggregated by age groups (10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age).

## 5. Dashboards { #5-dashboards } 

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Sexual and Reproductive Health”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.

![Dashboard](resources/images/chis-srh-db-001.png)

 The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
