# CHIS - Malaria { #chis-agg-mal-design }

## 1.Datasets { #1datasets } 

### 1.1. Résumé de la configuration { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - Malaria module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for malaria
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on malaria
3. Des **Indicateurs de base** pour les deux ensembles de données
4. A predefined **“CH - Malaria” dashboard**

Il est recommandé que les ensembles de données soient attribués aux unités d'organisation **au niveau le plus bas** possible du système de santé pour la déclaration des données, telles que les villages ou toute démarcation communautaire appropriée en fonction du contexte local.

### 1.2. Éléments de données { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the Malaria module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the Malaria module are used in the build up of indicators.

Just as for the DEs, in the table below the column “Indicator Groups” provides information about whether the indicator is found in groups other than the malaria indicator group.

## 5. Tableaux de bord { #5-dashboards }

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Malaria”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data the activities present in the different sections of the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.

La deuxième partie du tableau de bord est dédiée à l'ensemble de données annuel (Indicateurs d'évaluation annuels des ménages). Les éléments prédéfinis analysent et visualisent les principales composantes de l'ensemble de données, bien que le tableau de bord doive être modifié pour mieux refléter les activités locales.
