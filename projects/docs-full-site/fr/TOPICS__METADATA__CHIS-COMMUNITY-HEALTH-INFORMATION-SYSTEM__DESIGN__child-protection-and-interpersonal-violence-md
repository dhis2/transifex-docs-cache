# CHIS - Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence { #chis-agg-cpiv-design }

## 1. Dataset Configuration { #1-dataset-configuration } 

### 1.1. Résumé de la configuration { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence (CPIPV) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for child protection and interpersonal violence
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on child protection and interpersonal violence
3. Des **Indicateurs de base** pour les deux ensembles de données
4. A predefined **“CH - Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence” dashboard**

Il est recommandé que les ensembles de données soient attribués aux unités d'organisation **au niveau le plus bas** possible du système de santé pour la déclaration des données, telles que les villages ou toute démarcation communautaire appropriée en fonction du contexte local.

### 1.2. Éléments de données { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the CPIPV module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the CPIPV module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 5. Dashboards { #5-dashboards } 

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence”.
The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.

![Dashboards](resources/images/chis-cpiv-db-001.png)

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
