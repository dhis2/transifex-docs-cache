# COVID-19 Surveillance  { #covid-19-surveillance } 

DHIS2 released a digital metadata package to accelerate case detection, situation reporting, active surveillance and response for COVID-19. The design is inspired by the Ministry of Health Sri Lanka’s pioneering use of DHIS2 tracker for COVID-19 case detection and draws on years of collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to develop information system standards for case-based disease surveillance. The COVID-19 digital data package includes standard metadata aligned with the WHO’s [technical guidance on COVID-19 surveillance and case definitions](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions) and implementation guidance to enable rapid deployment in countries.

The design of these modules can be adapted, modified and reused for new and emerging infectious disease threats to strengthen health emergency preparedness and response systems in countries. 

## COVID-19 Surveillance Modules { #covid-19-surveillance-modules } 

DHIS2 supports surveillance workflows and automated analysis for key components of routine and active surveillance:

* **COVID-19 Case Surveillance tracker**: enrolls & tracks suspected cases; captures symptoms, demographics, risk factors & exposures; creates lab requests; links confirmed cases with contacts; and monitors patient outcomes. This package can be installed as a standalone COVID-19 package or can be integrated into a country’s existing integrated disease surveillance & response tracker.
* **Contact Registration & Follow-up tracker**: strengthens active case detection through contact tracing activities, such as identification and follow-up of contacts of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.
* **Ports of Entry Screening & Follow-up tracker**: enrols travellers who have visited high-risk locations at Ports of Entry for 14-day monitoring and follow-up.
* **COVID-19 Aggregate Situation Reports**: an aggregate reporting dataset that captures minimum necessary data points for daily or weekly reporting and includes key information for generating situation reports.
