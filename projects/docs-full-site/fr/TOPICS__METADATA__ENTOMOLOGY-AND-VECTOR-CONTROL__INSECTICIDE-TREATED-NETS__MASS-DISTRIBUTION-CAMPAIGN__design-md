# Insecticide-treated Nets (ITN) { #vc-itn-mc-design }

**Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)** have emerged as the most widely utilized and effective vector control (VC) intervention, contributing significantly to the substantial reduction in malaria cases across Africa in recent decades. These nets are specially designed to fulfill two crucial functions:

- **Mosquito Repellent and Elimination**: ITNs are impregnated with insecticides that not only repel but also eliminate mosquitoes upon contact. By deterring the insects from approaching the net, it diminishes the risk of mosquito bites.
- **Physical Barrier**: ITNs also serve as a physical barrier between mosquitoes and humans. This prevents infected mosquitoes from reaching and biting humans, thereby reducing the transmission of malaria.

ITNs are one of the two primary malaria vector control interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for large-scale implementation.

Distribution of ITNs typically occurs through two main approaches:

- **Mass Distribution**: ITNs are distributed extensively to the entire population once every 2-3 years. This approach ensures broad coverage and aims to reach as many individuals as possible.
- **Continuous Distribution**: ITNs can be distributed consistently through various channels such as antenatal care services, child immunization services, or school-based distributions. By integrating ITNs into existing healthcare platforms, regular and continuous access to nets is provided to the target populations.

By employing these distribution strategies, the goal is to maximize the accessibility and usage of ITNs, ultimately reducing malaria transmission and its associated burden.

## ITN Mass distribution campaign { #itn-masscampaign }

**ITN mass distribution campaign (ITN-MC)** aims to provide widespread access to insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for the entire population of a designated area. The primary objective is to ensure that every individual in the population has the opportunity to sleep under a net, thereby receiving protection against mosquito bites and reducing the risk of vector-borne diseases.

To effectively capture data from ITN campaigns, users can decide to either collect the single distribution events and households, or to aggregate the information on the area and the distributed bednets.

- **Tracker Program: The "VC-ITN-MC - Household Register"** tracker program enables the systematic registration of households on an individual basis. This program records the number of nets provided to each household, ensuring accurate tracking and distribution information.
- **Event Program: The "VC-ITN Mass Campaign"** event program enables the input of ITN campaign results into DHIS2. This program is utilized after the campaign has concluded, allowing for the documentation of campaign outcomes.

_OR_

- **Aggregate Data Sets Combination**: The combination of two aggregate data sets, namely **"VC-ITN-MC - Microplanning Information"** and **"VC-ITN-MC - Daily Summary Form"** facilitates the regular collection of data during the registration of households within the distribution area and throughout the actual net distribution process. These data sets are designed to capture information on a daily or weekly basis.

## Tracker program VC-ITN-MC - Household Register { #tracker-program-vc-itn-mc-household-register } 

This program is designed to facilitate the **registration of individual households before the campaign commences**, as well as record the number of nets allocated to each household during the campaign. This data is instrumental in calculating indicators that cannot be derived from other programs, specifically those related to ITN access. By capturing this information, the program enables a comprehensive assessment of ITN coverage and accessibility, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of the campaign in ensuring adequate protection against vector-borne diseases.

### Tracker Configuration { #tracker-configuration } 

| Étape        | Description and Metadata|
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Inscription   | Initial step of the registration of the TEI, the household   |
| Inscription | The stage collects information on the household (i.e. sleeping spaces, registered population and the number of nets allotted). |
| Distribution | The stage collects information on the number of ITNs issued, the name of the person that received the net and the ITN brand.   |

### Tracker Details { #tracker-details } 

#### Inscription { #enrollment } 

![Enrollment](resources/images/VC_ITN_HH_001.png)

The enrollment collects core information to identify the household, including its coordinates.

#### Registration { #registration } 

![HH registration](resources/images/VC_ITN_HH_002.png)

This stage captures data on the number of people living in the household, the number of sleeping places within the household and the number of ITNs allocated to the household based on national ITN allocation algorithms.

#### Distribution { #distribution } 

![ITN distribution](resources/images/VC_ITN_HH_003.png)

This stage captures data on the number of nets provided to the household, the name of the person that received them (optional DE) and the brand of the provided ITN. 

### Règles de programme { #program-rules }

This program does not have any program rules. However, if the number of nets allocated to each household is a defined function of the number of household residents or sleeping places, a program rule can be built to automatically calculate the number of nets that should be provided to the household. 

### Légendes { #legends } 

This package contains three legends
- **ITN- People per net**: to highlight places where the number of people per net is >1.8 in red and those where the number of people per net is ≤ 1.8  in green

- **VC-ITN-MC - Performance (0-80, 80-95, 95+)**: to highlight progress. For example, to mark whether the proportion of ITN distributed is approaching those initially allocated or still far. The category ranges (0-80, 80-95, 95+) can be adjusted based on country targets.

- **VC-ITN-MC - Variance**: to highlight when two indicator values are different (red). For example, to highlight the difference between the estimated ITN remaining at the end of the day and the reported ITN remaining at the end of the day.

### ![](resources/images/pivot_table/table_layout.png) { #program-indicators } 

This program contains several program indicators which are used by indicators to calculate standard campaign outcome indicators. The full list is available in the Metadata Reference File.

### Indicateurs { #indicators } 

The indicators are grouped in the indicator group named “VC-ITN- Mass Campaign- Household tracker”. THe full list is available in the Metadata Reference File](resources/reference/VC-ITN-MC-HH.xlsx).

## VC-ITN Mass Campaign - Event Program { #vc-itn-mass-campaign-event-program } 

### Event Configuration { #event-configuration } 

The event program facilitates the seamless input of ITN campaign results into DHIS2, serving as a valuable tool for documenting the outcomes of the campaign. It is specifically designed to be utilized **after the campaign has concluded**, ensuring efficient and comprehensive recording of campaign data.

| Population-level results | These sections gather data on the number of expected and registered people during the campaign     |
| Household-level results  | These sections gather data on the number of expected and registered households during the campaign |
| Bednet-level results  | This section gathers data on the numbers of nets planned and distributed |
| Observations  | Where to report the completeness of the event and eventual comments |

#### Éléments de donnée { #data-elements } 

The full list of data elements is available in the Metadata Reference File.

### Event Details { #event-details } 

#### New Event Registration { #new-event-registration } 

The creation of a new event requires the selection of:
- The “VC- ITN - Mass Campaign” program
- The VC-ITN Campaign - the ID of the campaign. By default the package includes some examples such as complete single years (2019 or 2020) for when a campaign is conducted in one specific year, or longer periods (2021-2022) for when the campaign is conducted across years. The ID can however be any identifier of the campaign, such as name, code, year, sequential numbers, or a combination of these.  
- The ITN distribution area from the Organization Unit (OU) hierarchy (this is the location where the net was distributed)

![Final sections of the program](resources/imagess/VC_ITN_CAM_007.png)

### Program Rules { #program-rules } 

This  program does not have any program rules.

### Analyse  { #analytics } 

#### Indicateurs de programme { #program-indicators } 
The list of PI is available in the Metadata Reference File. Some of the PI simply capture the value of a DE while others calculate the percentage of nets distributed of those plans, of households benefited of those registered and of people at risk benefit of those registered. The list of PIs can be expanded depending on local analytic needs.

The calculations in the screenshot below are visible directly from the event capture app and provide the key insights about the campaign under registration.

![Key calculations](resources/imagess/VC_ITN_CAM_008.png)

#### Légendes { #legends } 

This program includes one legend to be used in the visualizations.
**VC-ITN People per net** which creates two categories in the people per net indicator. Below 1.8 people per net (green good net coverage) and above 1.8 people per net (red, poor net coverage). 
Some countries may use the threshold of 2 (instead of 1.8). In this case the legend threshold should be adapted accordingly.

### Visualisations { #visualizations } 

The ITN campaign results dashboard (VC-ITN-MC) has four visualizations.

## Combination of aggregate datasets: VC-ITN-MC - Microplanning Information and VC-ITN-MC - Daily summary form { #combination-of-aggregate-datasets-vc-itn-mc-microplanning-information-and-vc-itn-mc-daily-summary-form } 

### Acknowledgement { #acknowledgement } 

This toolkit was created originally by Population Services International (PSI). The WHO has harmonized it to follow the naming style of other DHIS2 modules and made some modification to program indicators and dashboards.

### Data set VC-ITN-MC - Microplanning Information { #data-set-vc-itn-mc-microplanning-information } 

The data set is designed to capture crucial information during the ITN distribution campaign. It primarily focuses on estimating the number of households and individuals residing in the distribution area, facilitating a comparison of the campaign's progress against predetermined targets. However, it is important to note that **this data set should be completed only once at the beginning of the campaign**.

**In instances where countries or organizations already have population estimates stored within their DHIS2 instance, there is no requirement to install this particular data set**. Instead, they can utilize their existing estimates, eliminating the need for duplication.
If multiple ITN brands are being distributed within a single distribution area, additional data elements can be incorporated to capture information specific to each brand. This allows for comprehensive tracking of different net brands throughout the campaign.

![Microplanning information](resources/images/VC_ITN_MC_MICRO_001.png)

### Data set VC-ITN-MC - Daily summary form { #data-set-vc-itn-mc-daily-summary-form } 

This data set is split in two sections: **The first should be completed during household registration before starting ITN distribution, whereas the second should be completed during the distribution of ITNs**.  Both sections are configured to be completed daily but the frequency can be adjusted to meet the data collection needs of the country/institution. 

The first section (“Registration”) should be completed with information pertaining to the households and population present in the distribution area being registered. This involves capturing specific details such as the number of individuals, the count of available sleeping spaces, and the composition of households based on different sizes (e.g., 1-2 people, 3-4 people, etc.). Additionally, the data set should include the number of ITNs found among the registered population.

![Pre-campaign registration info](resources/images/VC_ITN_MC_MICRO_002.png)

The number of ITNs allocated to the registered population is typically calculated using algorithms specific to each country. These algorithms aid in bednet quantification, ensuring an appropriate allocation of ITNs based on factors such as population size, household composition, and other relevant considerations. The allocated nets will therefore represent the number of nets that the registered population should theoretically have based on the household composition and the number of people per net as per national guidelines. 

![Post-campaign nets distribution](resources/images/VC_ITN_MC_MICRO_003.png)

The distribution section should be completed as ITN is distributed. It contains the following data elements:
- ITNs prepositioned: ITNs sent from the central level to the distribution area on that day.
- ITNs opening balance:  ITN available for distribution at the beginning of the distribution day. 
- ITNs issued: ITNs given to the population during that day. 
- ITNs received: ITN received from other distribution areas during that day.
- ITNs redistributed: moved from this to other distribution areas (reallocated) during that day.
- ITNs lost: lost or stolen during the day.
- ITNs stock on hand: ITN left at the end of the day. 
- Households issued ITNs: number of households that received ITNs on that day.

The diagram below explains the flow of ITNs to illustrate the meaning of the different data elements. 

![Net distribution diagram](resources/images/VC_ITN_MC_MICRO_004.png)

### Indicateurs { #indicators } 

They are all grouped in the indicator grouped called “VC-ITN- Mass Campaign- Daily summary”

### Special considerations { #special-considerations } 

These documents outline three distinct options for collecting data during an ITN campaign. In cases where different options are employed in different regions or areas within a country, the collected data can be consolidated using indicators.

The distribution section of the “Daily Summary Form” could be also handled by the [**LMIS modules**](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/metadata/immunization/epi-logistics/lmis-design.html) available in DHIS2 as they provide the key information on the transaction of medical items. 

### Analyse  { #analytics } 

#### Légendes { #legends } 

This module contains three legends:
- **ITN- People per net**: to highlight places where the number of people per net is >1.8 in red and those where the number of people per net is ≤ 1.8  in green
- **VC-ITN-MC - Performance (0-80, 80-95, 95+)**: to highlight progress. For example, to mark whether the proportion of ITN distributed is approaching those initially allocated or still far. The category ranges (0-80, 80-95, 95+) can be adjusted based on country targets.
- **VC-ITN-MC - Variance**: to highlight when two indicator values are different (red). For example, to highlight the difference between the estimated ITN remaining at the end of the day and the reported ITN remaining at the end of the day.

#### Visualisations { #visualizations } 

The aggregate modules come with a dashboard called “**ITN Mass campaign (daily)**”  that contains the visualization outlined in the table below. If the frequency of data collection is not daily, the name of the dashboard should be adapted.
