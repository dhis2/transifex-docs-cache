# Promouvoir l'utilisation de l'application BNA { #adopting-the-use-of-the-bna-app } 

## Champ d'application de l'application { #scope-of-the-app } 

1.  Sur la base des décisions que le système doit prendre en charge (champ d'application du système) ;
    customization and adaptation of the BNA app will be needed. Each
    action will need special competence, and should be led by the core
    team.
2.  Assessment of the intended users and beneficiaries is important, as
    well as their information, and hardware and network needs.
3.  An understanding of the larger architecture of the national HIS is
    important; consideration for what other systems are in place, and
    how they should interact with BNA app? Also consider what needs
    there will be for interoperability between electronic systems.
4.  Si des besoins ne sont pas actuellement pris en charge par le DHIS2, un 
    assessment of additional software development is necessary. For
    example population data, HR data and denominator calculations not
    supported with the main DHIS2 core. These can be addressed locally
    by developing a custom web app or feed into the overall core
    platform development roadmap process organized by UiO.

## Installation et configuration { #setup-and-configuration } 

1.  Functionality of bottleneck analysis requires to carefully review
    meta-data before setup and configuration. The review should be led
    and spearheaded by the core team.
2.  Ensure that all required meta-data (data elements, organisation
    units, datasets and indicators ) are properly configured in the host
    system.
3.  Additional requirements such as data elements for calculating
    denominators should be carefully analysed and setup in the host
    system. In cases where data is to be imported from other legacy
    systems, an integration process need to be in place.
4.  Users and their appropriate roles need to be defined first in the
    DHIS2 and then in the BNA app for proper management.
