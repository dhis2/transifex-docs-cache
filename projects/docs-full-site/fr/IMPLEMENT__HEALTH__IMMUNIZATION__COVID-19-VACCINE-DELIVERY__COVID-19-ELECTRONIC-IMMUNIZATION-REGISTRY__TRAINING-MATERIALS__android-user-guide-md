# COVAC - Android User Guide { #covac-android-user-guide }

**DHIS2 Android App**

**DHIS2 Immunization Toolkit**

**COVID-19 Vaccination Registry**

## Introduction { #introduction } 

The DHIS2 Android app is optimized to use the COVID-19 immunization that is aligned with the WHO’s technical guidance on COVID-19 immunization case definitions and implementation guidance to enable rapid deployment in countries. This end-user manual will help the users in understanding the data entry for using the DHIS2 Android app for entering COVID-19 vaccination data.

Please also refer to the official DHIS2 android app documentation for further assistance:

1. [Implementation guidelines](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/understanding-dhis2-implementation/a-quick-guide-to-dhis2-implementation.html)
2. [Configuration guide](#implementation_guide_dhis2_config)

> **Note**
>
> The DHIS2 Android app allows offline data capture across all DHIS2 data models.
> Data and metadata are automatically synchronized whenever there is internet access, always keeping the most relevant data for the logged user in the device.

## Logging in { #logging-in } 

1. Enter the given URL in the browser (as provided) **or** use a QR code
2. Enter the username and password (as provided)
3. Select "Log in" after entering these details

![Log in screen](resources/images/android_covac_login_en.png)

The home screen will show a list of programs depending on your level of access within your system. In this example, both tracker programs and aggregate data sets are available to the user. _**[Note to trainer: modify this text to explain to your users what they will have access to]**_

> **Note**
>
> The android capture app allows a user to enter data from aggregate, event and tracker data models all within the same app

![Program Overview](resources/images/android_covac_program_en.png)

## Accessing the Program { #accessing-the-program } 

1. Select the COVID-19 Vaccination Registry program

   ![COVID-19 Vaccination Registry](resources/images/android_covac_program_en.png)

2. This will take you the home page of data entry

   ![Data Entry Home Page](resources/images/android_covac_home_page_en.png)

On this screen you will be able to search all the cases already registered in the system to make sure you do not enter duplicates. You need to enter at least one of the attributes to perform a search. _**[Note to trainer: this will vary based on how you set up your configuration; modify the minimum number of attributes needed to search accordingly].**_ Click on the magnifying glass icon to perform the actual search.

## Adding a New Person { #adding-a-new-person } 

> **Note**
>
> To add a new person, you will need to attempt a search first. When the search cannot find a result that meets your criteria, you will be able to add the person. Details that you fill in during your search will carry over and you will not need to re-enter them.

1. Enter your details
2. Attempt a search by selecting the magnifying glass icon

   ![Person's Details](resources/images/android_covac_person_details_en.png)

3. If no person is found, you will receive a message.
4. From here you can add a new person by selecting the “+” icon

   ![Feedback Message](resources/images/android_covac_feedback_message_en.png)

5. Select the location in which to register the new person
6. Select Accept to continue

   ![Location](resources/images/android_covac_location_en.png)

7. Select the registration date
8. Select “Accept” to continue.

   ![Date of Registration](resources/images/android_covac_reg_date_en.png)

   > **Note**
   >
   > You can change the calender view by selecting the “Change Clander View” option available on the Date window.

   This will take you to the “Registration screen” where you can finalize the registration of the person.

9. Enter any remaining details for the person in the “Attributes – Person” section

   ![Attributes](resources/images/android_covac_attributes_en.png)

10. Select the save button when all the information is entered

   > **Tip**
   >
   > 1. Use the arrow keys to expand each section
   > 2. Any information you have already entered during your search will carry over. You can add additional details as required. If you are generating an ID, it will generate at this stage of the data entry.

This will register the new case and take you to the data entry dashboard of the case. This is where you will be entering the relevant information to be captured in the vaccination program.

> **Note**
>
> A user can search across all programs using one tracked entity type (TET). In the Search screen there is a drop-down menu which shows all the programs available for the active TET (active TET is defined by the selection of the program in the home screen). That drop down should also have an option with the TET name. (for example: person)
>
> When the user selects that option, the search fields available will only be the TET attributes (no program specific attributes). Search restrictions do not apply, because they belong to the programs
>
> If you search across all programs and find the person you intend to register is already registered in another program, you should not register them again.

![Search](resources/images/android_covac_search_en.png)

## Exploring the Tracker Dashboard { #exploring-the-tracker-dashboard } 

Within the person’s tracker dashboard, there are 4 separate sections that you can navigate to:

1. Overview : this is the default section and is most relevant to the vaccination use-case
2. Indicators : any individual, calculated indicators about the person will be shown here. It is like the “indicators” widget within the web-based version of tracker capture
3. Relationships : here you can add relationships to other tracked entities in the system (such as other people)
4. Notes : notes can be added about the individual person

![Tracker Dashboard](resources/images/android_covac_tracker_dashboard_en.png)

The **filter** button allows you to filter the events within a single person’s dashboard

## Manually Synchronizing Data { #manually-synchronizing-data } 

Your device will automatically synchronize data based on the schedule that has defined by your system administrator(s). You may want to manually sync your data however. There are several locations that will inform you of the sync status of your data.

On the android home page, you will see this gray arrow icon when there is data that has not yet been synced within a program

![Sync Button](resources/images/android_covac_sync_button_en.png)

> **Note**
>
> Programs/datasets with no indicator next to their name indicate that all data has been synced.

Within the main data entry page when you review your list of people, you will see a gray arrow icon when there is data that has not yet been synced for an individual.

![Enrollment Sync](resources/images/android_covac_sync_button_enrollment_en.png)

Within a person’s dashboard when you are reviewing events, you will see a gray arrow icon when there is data that has not yet been synced for an event.

![Event Sync](resources/images/android_covac_sync_button_event_en.png)

You can sync data by selecting this gray icon when you have an internet connection. You will be asked to confirm that you want to send this data. Once this is complete, you will receive a message indicating the data has been sent successfully.

![Sync Screen](resources/images/android_covac_sync_screen_en.png)

![Sync Result](resources/images/android_covac_sync_result_en.png)

> **Note**
>
> The amount of data that is sent will be dependent on where you trigger the synchronization from. If you trigger this for only one record, only one record will be synchronized. To send all the data for one program, you can trigger the synchronization from the android home page.

![Data Sync](resources/images/android_covac_sync_button_en.png)

If you want to synchronize data for multiple programs and/or datasets at the same time, you can do this by accessing the settings from the android home page

1. Select the Menu button on the android home page
2. Select “Settings”
3. Select the “Sync data” menu option
4. Select “Sync data now”

![Sync Settings](resources/images/android_covac_sync_settings_en.png)
