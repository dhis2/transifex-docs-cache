# Release Note { #tb-cs-release-note }

## 2.0.0 { #200 } 

A new version of the WHO-approved TB Case Surveillance Tracker package (v2.0.0) has been released with new content, configuration fixes and improvements.

### Enrollment Stage { #enrollment-stage } 

In version 2.0.0 the diagnosis was moved from the “Enrollment” to the “Diagnosis and Notification” stage for better support of the laboratory vs clinical workflows. The diagnosis and notification of a confirmed case can therefore happen once the diagnostic test results are available and the clinician can confirm the case together with the baseline information, the risk factors, and the HIV status.
Once a case is diagnosed/confirmed/notified, the user is prompted to enter the TB registration number in the “Enrollment” stage.

### Denotification of a negative presumptive case { #denotification-of-a-negative-presumptive-case } 

In version 1.0.1, denotification was possible in the “Outcome” stage and supported two scenarios:

   1. Denotification of a duplicate case
   2. Denotification of a case notified/confirmed as a result of human error

In version 2.0.0 that supports enrollment of presumptive cases, denotification of a negative presumptive case can happen directly in the "Diagnosis and Notification" stage. Such cases will be excluded from the analysis (except for the lab data).

### Laboratory Results Stage { #laboratory-results-stage } 

Version 1.0.1 contained only one repeatable laboratory stage in which all the tests were entered and displayed.

In version 2.0.0, laboratory stage was renamed into “Diagnostic Laboratory Results” stage. Additional sample related variables were added. A new “Monitoring Laboratory Results” stage has been added. Both stages are repeatable. With this design, it is easier to distinguish between the tests that were performed for diagnostic purposes and those performed for monitoring purposes among the confirmed cases.

### Working Lists { #working-lists } 

Version 2.0.0 contains only 2 working lists in the tracker dashboard:
“All current enrollments” and “Enrollment completion pending”

For custom working lists that can filter enrollments by specific data coming from a specific program stage, it is recommended to configure relevant SQL views or use line lists.

### Notifications (system, SMS, etc) { #notifications-system-sms-etc } 

Version 2.0.0 contains four notification templates that allow users to send messages to clients and other program users. These include notification, denotification and poor sample quality notifications.

### Fixes & Improvements { #fixes-improvements } 

For further information on the differences between the two versions of the TB-CS tracker, implementers and users can refer to the [diff file](resources/tb_cs-1.0.1-vs-2.0.0.xlsx).
