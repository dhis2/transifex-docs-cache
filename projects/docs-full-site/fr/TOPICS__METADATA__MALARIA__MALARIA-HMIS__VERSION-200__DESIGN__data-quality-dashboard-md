# Malaria Data Quality Dashboard { #mal-agg-dq-design }

## Introduction { #introduction }

The WHO Malaria Data Quality (DQ) dashboard is an addendum to the [malaria burden reduction aggregate package](https://dhis2.org/who-package-downloads/#malaria). Like all the aggregate packages, this has been developed as an installable solution for countries to update their DHIS2-based HMIS, specifically the malaria aggregate indicators and dashboard.

This chapter provides an overview of the design principles that have been applied within the core DHIS2 features for monitoring and improvement of data quality through DHIS2 dashboards. This dashboard complements other DHIS2 apps and tools such as the [WHO Data Quality App for DHIS2](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/optional-apps/who-data-quality-tool/installation-and-configuration.html). This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localization of the package and this package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines.

The objectives of the data quality dashboard are to:

1. Bring key data quality metrics to the users routinely through use of DHIS2 dashboards to facilitate data quality improvement activities;
2. Monitor completeness and timeliness of reporting malaria data;
3. Monitor completeness of reporting of core malaria data variables in the monthly health facility reporting form;
4. Monitor internal consistency between variables to detect inconsistencies for quality improvements;
5. Compare trends of key malaria indicators at the various reporting levels and rapidly detect anomalies as red flags for poor data quality.

The system design builds upon existing malaria aggregate guidelines principles and information system requirements that have been developed collaboratively between the WHO and UiO since 2017. It is important to note that national guidelines and policies may vary and therefore it is recommended to adapt this package to local contexts.

## Design Summary { #design-summary }

Lors de l’élaboration de ce package de configuration, nous avons essayé de respecter les [principes généraux de conception] (https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/general_design_principles.html) et une [convention d’appellation] commune (https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/naming_convention.html) de l’Université d’Oslo.

The malaria Data Quality dashboard includes:

1. Indicators: data quality indicators and other relevant indicators borrowed from malaria burden reduction package..
2. Visualizations/analytic items: charts and pivot tables to visualize indicator performance
3. Dashboard: designed to present the visuals/analytic items (charts and tables) in a logical way to users

Like all dashboard packages for DHIS2, the data visualizations are configured to display data for the organisation units for which the user has data capture access in the user configuration. In this way, the dashboard can be used at national, district or other sub-national levels to monitor data quality for the geographic area most relevant to the user. This enables actions to improve data quality to be taken as close to the point of data collection and validation as possible. Configuration of users and assignment to user groups to be able to access the dashboard should be considered within country context to ensure access is provided properly to users.

### Utilisateurs cibles { #intended-users }

-   Health facility users: monitor completeness and consistency of data reported from the facility, which could support onsite data reviews, checking for data quality errors and cleaning for quality improvement (according to national policies & SOPs)
-   District health managers: monitor data quality and detect facilities where data quality improvement may be needed; use the dashboard to provide feedback loops to facilities and plan data quality improvement follow-ups or other technical assistance activities
-   National malaria program managers: monitor data quality and develop national data quality improvement plans; understand the potential biases in the routine data set to improve their ability to analyze routine malaria data and consider data quality limitations

## Indicateurs { #indicators }

Indicators are based on the data elements included in the WHO malaria burden reduction package for HMIS, which includes a monthly aggregate dataset. These indicators are used to develop dashboard items and all indicators are assigned to the indicator group "Malaria data quality".

## Visualisations { #visualizations }

For each of the indicators outlined above, visualization items have been created using tables and charts as shown below. This covers data quality analysis on completeness, timeliness and consistency of data and visualization. Color legends have also been used on pivot tables to show thresholds of performance with extremes of "red" and "green" flags to indicate low and high quality data respectively. These legends can be adapted by the country according to their own thresholds.

## Tableau de bord { #dashboard }

All data visualization items created have been configured on a single dashboard named 'Malaria Data Quality' and below is a snapshot of the dashboard with some of the items as displayed. By default, the Malaria Data Quality dashboard within the package is configured to be shared with the User Group 'Malaria access', which is the same user group used to provide access to dashboards in the Burden Reduction package.
