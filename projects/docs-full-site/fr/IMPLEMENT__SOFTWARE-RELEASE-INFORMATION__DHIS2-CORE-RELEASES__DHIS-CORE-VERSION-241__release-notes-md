## Updates by component { #updates-by-component } 

### Login { #login } 
#### [New, customizable version of the Login App [ROADMAP-46]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/issues/ROADMAP-46)   { #new-customizable-version-of-the-login-app-roadmap-46httpsdhis2atlassiannetissuesroadmap-46 } 
In v41, a new login app built on React is introduced. This app provides customizable configuration options, allowing easy customization of the login experience to match your specific context.  

### Maintenance { #maintenance } 
#### [Maintenance App redesign MVP [ROADMAP-47]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/issues/ROADMAP-47)   { #maintenance-app-redesign-mvp-roadmap-47httpsdhis2atlassiannetissuesroadmap-47 } 
Introducing the first preview of the completely new Maintenance App. In v41 we are releasing the data element sections with new modules continuously introduced as they are developed. The updated features include advanced filtering options, bulk sharing capabilities, and a sleeker user interface.   

### System wide features  { #system-wide-features } 
#### [Optionsets multiselect support for individual data [ROADMAP-72]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/issues/ROADMAP-72) [[DHIS2-16211]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-16211) { #optionsets-multiselect-support-for-individual-data-roadmap-72httpsdhis2atlassiannetissuesroadmap-72-dhis2-16211httpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-16211 } 
Dhis2 will support from this version support the selection of multiple options for datasets for both aggregated and individual multi-select data elements. They will also be available for analysis through indicators and program indicators.

#### [Custom Icons](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-14272)  { #custom-iconshttpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-14272 } 
DHIS2 2 now allows uploading custom icons, expanding beyond the built-in library, to allow for context-specific icons such as those used by the Ministry of Health or NGO, as well as expand the availability of icons for non-health-related areas. These icons are available across the web and Android, and are configured via Maintenance DHIS2 Web App.

### Aggregated Data Entry { #aggregated-data-entry } 
#### [Custom Forms Functionality [ROADMAP-44]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/issues/ROADMAP-44)   { #custom-forms-functionality-roadmap-44httpsdhis2atlassiannetissuesroadmap-44 } 
We are adding more configuration options to the aggregate data entry form to allow you to customise the look and feel of the data entry form without building a custom HTML form. We have started with the option to pivot categories as rows and have data elements as columns or move a category to a row. You can now also add rich text fields before and after a section.

### Capture (web) { #capture-web } 

#### Capture App Feature Parity with Tracker Capture { #capture-app-feature-parity-with-tracker-capture } 
From v41, Capture and Tracker Capture are considered feature equal. This means that the software development team is not adding any further functionality to Tracker Capture, only fixing critical/security bugs if discovered. The Tracker Capture app and old tracker endpoint are now deprecated, and will not be bundled into v42.

Since the Capture app is on continuous release, you can also use this app from 2.38 and above. There are certain features that have needed new backend dependencies, but if those are not required for you, you can use the app management app and update the app to newer versions on 2.38 and above.

The features that need specific backend versions are the following:
- Changelog, previously audit log (v41 and above)
- Image thumbnails in working lists, forms, and widgets (Currently v41, but will soon be supported for lower versions)

There are also several features that are only available in the Capture app which we hope will encourage you to test it out. These include:
- Working lists: The ability to configure, save, and share working lists in the UI itself (Rather than through API as in Tracker Capture), including program stage working lists.
- Scheduling: The ability to use program rules to calculate the next scheduled date (assigned to a data element) which can then be used as the default date when scheduling. (Docs)
- Configure widgets and layout: Similar to Tracker Capture, but done in the data store, meaning it will be the same for all users and stay consistent, with the possibility to have a different layout for the Enrollment Dashboard and the Program stage event workspace.

#### [Relationship improvements](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-12361) { #relationship-improvementshttpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-12361 } 
The relationships widget is updated for the Capture app with various improvements

#### [Inheritable attributes for relationships](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-16123)  { #inheritable-attributes-for-relationshipshttpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-16123 } 
When creating a tracked entity through a relationship, tracked entity attributes configured with “inherit” will be prefilled with values from the source tracked entity in order to reduce data entry burden and improve data quality

#### [Growth chart widget based on WHO Child Growth Standards](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/09f48f78-b67c-4efa-90ad-9ac2fed53bb8) { #growth-chart-widget-based-on-who-child-growth-standardshttpsappsdhis2orgapp09f48f78-b67c-4efa-90ad-9ac2fed53bb8 } 
The Capture App now includes a growth chart widget for individual tracked entities, based on the WHO z-scores for:
- Head circumference for age
- Length/height for age
- Weight for age
- Weight for length/height

#### [Download working lists](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-13233) { #download-working-listshttpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-13233 }

Individual tracked entities in working lists can now be marked for follow-up, and filtered to provide a list of all designated for follow-up

#### [Related Stages Widget](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-16291) { #related-stages-widgethttpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-16291 } 
The referral widget has been updated and renamed the "Related Stages Widget" in the Capture app with additional functionality and improved user experience.

#### [Ownership transfer between org units](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-16322) { #ownership-transfer-between-org-unitshttpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-16322 } 
In order to support referall workflows and correct attribution of analytics, we have completed the ownership transfer of enrollments between org units. The ownership transfer overwrites the ownership field of an enrollment, while preserving the enrolling org unit and event org unit fields

#### [Allow one time referrals between org units]  { #allow-one-time-referrals-between-org-units } 
One time referrals are now supported in the Capture app, allowing for a selected org unit to access an enrollment without overwriting the ownership field.

#### [Images displayed in working lists](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-15391) { #images-displayed-in-working-listshttpsdhis2atlassiannetbrowsedhis2-15391 } 
Image attributes can now be displayed in working lists, to easier enable identification of tracked entities for use cases such as patient identification; inventory management; lab equipment monitoring; etc.

As a part of the platform strategy to support greater customizability and external development, we have added extension points to the Capture App allowing DHIS2 application developers to inject custom plugins in the data entry form as well as the enrollment dashboard. For an example of this in action, see the new growth charts and documentation, which were built using these same extension points. 

#### [API harmonization: Harmonized names and parameters in /tracker API](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-releases/blob/master/releases/2.41/README.md#tracker) { #api-harmonization-harmonized-names-and-parameters-in-tracker-apihttpsgithubcomdhis2dhis2-releasesblobmasterreleases241readmemdtracker } 
We have completed a full review of the /tracker API and made significant changes in order to harmonize names and parameters for consistency and ease of use. These improvements include some breaking changes that should be noted and addressed. See details in the v41 README, as well as the documentation.
