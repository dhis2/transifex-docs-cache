# AEFI Data Entry Exercises { #aefi-data-entry-exercises }

**DHIS2 Immunization Toolkit**

**Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)**

## Preparation Notes { #preparation-notes }

You will need to review these exercises and modify them based on your specific workflow. Areas that may be skipped or modified are noted but this is also meant to be at your discretion to modify, remove or add to freely. Each exercise refers to an accompanying quick guide that has more detailed instructions on a specific task outlined within an exercise and is meant for the learner to take as a job aid after the training is complete.

You will need to prepare use cases to be entered into DHIS2 within these exercises. If you have real, previously filled AEFI forms that are routinely used this will be the most ideal solution. If you do not, fill in some forms that can be used during the training. You can refer to the AEFI reporting forms and storylines included for reference in order to assist you in formulating data to be created for these forms.

The 3 types of user accounts you used for the demo will also need to be available for others to use. These user types can be modified based on your specific workflow; however, the user groups should be present and configured to correctly receive the program notifications within the program. This is discussed in more detail within the accompanying Trainer’s guide and the AEFI system design doc.

Each of the exercises refers to an accompanying quick guide as a reminder for the process being demonstrated. You will need to update the quick guides to reflect your configuration before sharing them for use as job aids during training and within the context of your own implementation.

If you are planning to enter data in real time, please refer to the AEFI storyline’s in helping you to create use-cases for data entry.

## Exercise 1 - Register a new case { #exercise-1-register-a-new-case }

In the first exercise, you will register a new AEFI into DHIS2 using tracker capture. In order to complete the exercise, you will need to refer to your filled in AEFI reporting form (note to trainer: replace this with an interview, case-study or other system if data entry is occurring in real time).

Follow these steps to register a new case:

1. Login as the facility user (note to trainer: ensure that this user type is pre-configured for the participant and replace the user type as required [ie. if the user is called something other than a facility user rename this user type]; a template account or their actual account can be used)
2. Go to Apps - > Tracker Capture
3. Select the facility in which you are working with
4. Select the program Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) (note to trainer: replace this program name if you have named it something else)
5. Select the “Register” button
6. Enter the details of your case taken from the AEFI reporting from
7. If using an ID generated by the system, write it down on the AEFI reporting form
8. Click on “Save and continue” to enter the case’s dashboard
9. Review

Refer to the first quick guide “AEFI Quick Guide – Register a new case” for a reminder on how to register a new AEFI in DHIS2.

## Exercise 2 - Fill in AEFI details { #exercise-2-fill-in-aefi-details }

In exercise 2, you will fill in the details associated with the first stage of the program - also known as “AEFI” within the case reporting form. In order to complete the exercise, you will need to refer to all the details up to the “First decision making level to complete” section of your filled in case reporting form (note to trainer: replace this with an interview or other system if data entry is occurring in real time).

Follow these steps when entering data into stage 1:

1. Within the case’s tracker dashboard, review the data entry page. The “report compilation date” will be automatically populated.
2. You will notice a number of fields can be hidden or shown In our system, responses to the following fields will either keep fields hidden or enable them for data entry:
    1. If the case is not female and greater than 10 years of age, you will not be able to enter data for “Is the patient pregnant” and “Is the patient lactating”
    2. If there is no severe local reaction, you will not be able to enter data for “> 3 days” and “Beyond nearest joint”
3. Enter the details of your case as taken from the initial part of the AEFI case reporting form. STOP when you reach the “First Decision making level to complete” section of the case reporting form.
4. When you have completed entering details for the case, select the “Complete” button at the bottom of the data entry form. It will ask you to confirm if you want to complete the selected event; select “Complete” once again.

Refer to the first quick guide “AEFI Quick Guide – Data Entry – AEFI ” for a reminder on how to register a new AEFI in DHIS2.
