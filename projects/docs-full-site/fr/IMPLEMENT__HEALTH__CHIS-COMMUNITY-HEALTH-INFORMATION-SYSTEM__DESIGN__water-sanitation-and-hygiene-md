# CHIS - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene { #chis-agg-wash-design }

## 1. Ensembles de données { #1-datasets }

### 1.1. Résumé de la configuration { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) module includes:

1. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information
2. **Core indicators** for the dataset
3. A predefined **“CH - WASH” dashboard**

Il est recommandé que les ensembles de données soient attribués aux unités d'organisation **au niveau le plus bas** possible du système de santé pour la déclaration des données, telles que les villages ou toute démarcation communautaire appropriée en fonction du contexte local.

### 1.2. Éléments de données { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the WASH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations. In this case the DEs in the WASH module are not shared among any other module.

All the DEs in the WASH module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Informations sur les ensembles de données { #2-dataset-details } 

### 2.1. Yearly WASH Dataset { #21-yearly-wash-dataset } 

#### 2.1.1. Drinking Water { #211-drinking-water } 

The section reports data on access to drinking water among the assessed households. The disaggregation of the data is by type of source of water (piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, packaged or delivered water - the categories should be adapted to better mirror the local context).

![Drinking Water](resources/images/chis-wash-y-001.png)

#### 2.1.2. Water Quality { #212-water-quality } 

The section focuses on the tests conducted on the water. The tests are disaggregated by results (positive and negative) and/or by source of the water (piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, packaged or delivered water - the categories should be adapted to better mirror the local context).

![Water Quality](resources/images/chis-wash-y-002.png)

#### 2.1.3. Hand-Washing Facilities { #213-hand-washing-facilities } 

The section reports the presence of fixed or mobile hand-washing facilities among the households. The disaggregation of the facilities is by location (dwelling, plot/yard, elsewhere). The categories can be edited according to the local context.

![Hand-Washing Facilities](resources/images/chis-wash-y-003.png)

#### 2.1.4.Improved/Shared Sanitation { #214improvedshared-sanitation } 

The section provides information on households sharing facilities (disaggregated by type of facility) and those having access to improved facilities (disaggregated by type of improved facility).

![Improved/Shared Sanitation](resources/images/chis-wash-y-004.png)

#### 2.1.5. Emptying of On-Site Sanitation Facilities { #215-emptying-of-on-site-sanitation-facilities } 

The section reports data on sanitation that are located on site and how they are emptied, if ever. The information is disaggregated by emptying method (service provider, buried, uncovered pit, open ground, water body, elsewhere - the options should be adapted to better mirror the local context) and by type of toilet/storage (latrines, septic tanks, composting toilet, twin pits).

![Emptying of On-Site Sanitation Facilities](resources/images/chis-wash-y-005.png)

#### 2.1.6. Hygiene Facilities { #216-hygiene-facilities } 

The section collects information on women and their accessibility to hygenic spaces and materials during their menses. The data on hygiene product is disaggregated by product type (Sanitary pads - disposable, sanitary pads - reusable, cloths - disposable, cloths - reusable, tampons - disposable, menstrual cups - reusable, other - disposable, other - reusable, none).

## 3. Règles de validation { #3-validation-rules }

The following validation rules have been set up for the WASH dataset:

## 5. Tableaux de bord { #5-dashboards }

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - WASH”.

The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.
