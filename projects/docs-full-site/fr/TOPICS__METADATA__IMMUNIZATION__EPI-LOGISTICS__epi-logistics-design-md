## 1. About the WHO HMIS-LMIS Integrated Analysis Package for DHIS2 { #1-about-the-who-hmis-lmis-integrated-analysis-package-for-dhis2 } 

Although many countries have electronic logistics management information systems already implemented, these are generally optimized for warehouse reporting and often do not extend to facility level. As a result, the lack of logistics data from facilities represents a reporting gap.

Due to the appropriateness of the system for health facility reporting and the scale of field implementation across the world, DHIS2 has already been implemented for basic facility stock reporting in terms of data inputs (health facility reporting forms, data elements), and outputs (indicators, charts and dashboards).

The LMIS data model provides a complete DHIS2 configuration to support the adoption of WHO-recommended logistics indicators and their triangulation with the HMIS for analytic purposes.
This LMIS configuration is not intended to replace a functional logistics management information system.
The key objectives of this package are to:

* Promouvoir les bonnes pratiques en matière d'analyse intégrée et de triangulation des données relatives à la prestation de services et des données logistiques clés pour un programme de santé donné ;

* Establish guidance/standards for key stock/logistics data that can be
a) reported from health facilities into DHIS2 in the absence of an alternative LMIS that reaches facility level
**OR**
b) imported/received from a functional electronic logistics information system.

Le présent document est destiné aux chargés de la mise en œuvre de DHIS2 au niveau national et régional, afin qu'ils puissent accompagner la mise en œuvre et la localisation de l'ensemble. Les flux de données locaux et les directives nationales doivent être pris en compte lors de la localisation et de l'adoption des programmes inclus dans ce package.

## 2. System Design Summary { #2-system-design-summary } 

The logistics metadata is designed to be harmonized conceptually across different health programmes. To ease the adoption of these packages in countries, we have included the program-specific metadata into existing DHIS2 metadata packages - namely HIV, malaria, and TB.

The aggregate packages therefore include:

1. Dashboards to support integrated analysis of HMIS and LMIS data
2. Indicators and predictors to generate calculated values
3. Data sets and data elements for facility reporting of logistics data

The following table provides a summary of the key logistics data concepts that are applied in a standard way to the configuration across the system and health programmes.

| Stock de départ (calculé)      | The opening balance of the current period carries over and is equal to the to the stock on hand from the previous period (and theoretically, unless there are discrepancy issues, to the closing balance from the same previous period)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Data Element is populated by a predictor in the standard configuration.  As this field is automatically calculated by DHIS2 it is not editable and therefore greyed out. |   |   |
| Stock reçu (enregistré)         | Total quantity of stocks received during the reporting period. These may also be referred to as 'stock receipts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Data Element is to be entered by the user in the Stock Form.                                                                                                             |   |   |
| Stocks issued (recorded)          | The quantities of stock physically distributed from the pharmacy and which are either directly dispensed to patients or issued to wards, outpatient departments or other services as part of patient service delivery. Stock issues are commonly referred to as "consumption".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Data Element is to be entered by the user in the Stock Form.                                                                                                             |   |   |
| Stocks redistributed (recorded)   | The quantity of stock redistributed back into the supply chain (for example to district stores or other health facilities) and is no longer intended for the patients of the reporting health facility. This refers to stock that leaves the facility but was not issued to patients or used during service delivery. Stocks "redistributed" upstream (for example to the district level) are often referred to as "returns".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Data Element is to be entered by the user in the Stock Form.                                                                                                             |   |   |
| Stocks discarded(recorded)        | The quantity of stock that was discarded (removed from stock and disposed of) due to expiry or damage. For these stock losses (also referred to as "wastage") the reason is known, and they are considered as accounted for. In the EPI Stock data entry the Discarded stock has been broken down by reason: Frozen vials, Expired vials, Broken Vials, and vials that have passed the discard point due to a darkened VVM label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                          |   |   |
| Stock on hand(recorded)           | Quantity of stock physically available and accounted for in the pharmacy or store.The stock on hand must be equal to the "Closing balance" for all health products. In case any discrepancy is found, the storekeeper first needs to try to reconcile the data and identify any potential mistakes such as miscounting, calculation errors or any transactions which were not yet recorded. If the data can be reconciled the "Closing balance" will correctly display zero. If no mistakes can be found and the stock discrepancy remains unexplained the storekeeper records a corresponding "Stock correction" which brings the "Closing balance" to zero. The "Stock correction" corresponds to "unaccounted losses". | Data Element is to be entered by the user in the Stock Form.                                                                                                             |   |   |
| Number of stockout days(recorded) | Count of the number of days during the reporting period in which the respective health product was out of stock at any time or for any period of the day. The number of stockout days are one of the logistics performance indicators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Data Element is to be entered by the user in the Stock Form.                                                                                                             |   |   |

| Écart  de stock (%)              | Any difference between the calculated closing balance and the recorded stock on hand. The stock discrepancies are automatically calculated by subtracting the calculated closing balance from the recorded stock on hand and may be caused by mistakes during data entry, miscounting, pilfering or mislaying stocks. Most times the resulting value is negative (<0) →  the stock discrepancy then corresponds to losses which are unaccounted for and cannot be explained. Occasionally the stock discrepancy may assume positive values ("excess stocks", >0) - e.g. if the recorded quantity of stock issued is larger than the physically issued quantity or if received stocks were not recorded. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Tous les indicateurs de base sont configurés **par élément** en fonction du programme de santé.

This metadata package allows recording of two critical logistics performance management indicators: stock losses and the number of stockout days.

The **number of stockout days** is a key performance indicator for assessing the quality of demand planning, forecasting, stock replenishment calculations, ordering as well as the reliability and timeliness of upstream logistics services for delivering health products. All health products should be in stock at all times and any stockout needs to be addressed and resolved urgently.

**Stock losses** ("wastage") is the second critical logistics performance indicator which is reported. Stock losses are either "Stocks discarded" because they were damaged, expired or became unusable for other reasons ("accounted losses") or "Stock corrections" which represent the unexplained and "unaccounted losses" for which the reason is unknown.

## 4. Intended users { #4-intended-users } 

* **Les utilisateurs des établissements de santé** : saisissent et communiquent des données logistiques essentielles pour des programmes de santé spécifiques. Le rapport sur les stocks de l'établissement est généralement utilisé par les pharmaciens et les magasiniers pour enregistrer toutes les données essentielles sur les stocks de l'établissement de santé à la fin de chaque mois. Les magasiniers conservent leurs documents papier habituels, tels que les fiches de stock et les fiches d'emplacement, pour enregistrer les entrées et les sorties de stock. À la fin de chaque mois, les données de ces registres sont saisies dans DHIS2 pour le partage des données.

* **Les gestionnaires de programmes nationaux et infranationaux (par exemple au niveau du district)** : pour le suivi des performances générales du programme de santé, l'analyse et le recoupement des données relatives à la logistique et à la prestation des services de santé afin de prendre des décisions éclairées sur les interventions programmatiques.

## 5. Data Set { #5-data-set } 

### 5.1 Data Entry Form (facility reporting) { #51-data-entry-form-facility-reporting } 

![**EPI_Dataentry_01**](resources/images/EPI_Dataentry_01.png)

The "Opening balance" field will automatically display the Stock on hand from the last day of the previous period.

At the end of every period, the storekeeper will add up the totals for the "Stocks received", "Stocks issued", "Stocks discarded" as well as "Stocks redistributed" during the entire reporting period and record them in DHIS2 for each health product.

Le magasinier procède ensuite à un inventaire physique complet de tous les produits de santé et enregistre le stock disponible (quantité totale physiquement disponible dans le magasin médical) dans DHIS2.

Enfin, le magasinier examinera les registres des stocks et comptera le nombre de jours au cours de la période de déclaration pendant lesquels le produit de santé concerné a été en rupture de stock à un moment donné ou pendant une période donnée de la journée.

### 5.2 Program-specific analytics { #52-program-specific-analytics } 

From the data captured, we can calculate the following indicators which are recommended by the WHO for integrated analysis alongside indicators contained in the WHO HMIS health programmes packages.
