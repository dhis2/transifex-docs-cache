# CHIS - Population Composition { #chis-agg-pop-design }

## 1. Datasets { #1-datasets } 

### 1.1. Configuration Summary { #11-configuration-summary } 

The aggregate CH - Population composition (POP) module includes:

1. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key POP data elements
2. **Core POP indicators**
3. A predefined **“CH - Population composition”** dashboard

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements { #12-data-elements } 

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the AH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations. As the population DEs are very much linked to the activities that are carried out, the DEs should be modified, or new ones should be added, to better mirror the activities. Please note that some population denominators are also found in other modules (e.g. Women and girls surveyed in the households visits, Screened children <5y, People (>18m) in the catchment area) and it is up to the user to decide whether they want to keep them in the current module or if they prefer moving them to the POP module.

All the DEs in the POP module are used in the build up of indicators.

In the table below there are some examples of DEs that are not in the POP module but that nonetheless could be considered as population denominators. As aforementioned, it is up to the user to modify the modules in order to better represent the local context/activities, and to facilitate the collection of population data.
