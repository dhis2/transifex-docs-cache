# CH - Community-based surveillance (CBS) { #ch-cbs-aggregate-design }

## 1. Datasets { #1-datasets }

### 1.1. Configuration Summary { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - Community-based surveillance module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for CBS
2. **Core indicators** for the dataset
3. A predefined **“CH - Community-based surveillance” dashboard**

Il est recommandé que les ensembles de données soient attribués aux unités d'organisation **au niveau le plus bas** possible du système de santé pour la déclaration des données, telles que les villages ou toute démarcation communautaire appropriée en fonction du contexte local.

## 1.2. Data Elements { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the CBS module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations. In this case, the CBS DEs are not shared with any other module.

All the DEs in the CBS module are used in the build up of indicators.

| Nom | Description | Ventilation | Ensembles de données | Data Element Groups |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CH173a - Events/alert case detected | Events/alert case detected | default | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |  |
| CH173b - Events/alert case detected referred | Events/alert case detected referred | default | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |  |
| CH174a - CBS alerts with timely response | CBS alerts responded to within 24 hours or within specified time period from the CBS protocol | default | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |  |
| CH174b - CBS alerts | CBS alerts | default | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |  |
| CH175a - Communities in action after alerts | Communities in which action was taken following an alert (per month) | default | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |  |
| CH175b - Communities with alert(s) | Communities in which there was at least an alert (per month) | default | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |  |

## 2. Datasets Details { #2-datasets-details }

### 2.1. CBS Dataset { #21-cbs-dataset }

The section is set to collect the information necessary to monitor the knowledge and reactivity of the community for alerts and events.

## 3. Validation Rules { #3-validation-rules }

The following validation rules have been set up for the CBS datasets:

| Nom | Description | Ensembles de données | Groupes d'éléments de données |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CH173a - Events/alert case detected | Events/alert case detected | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH173b - Events/alert case detected referred | Events/alert case detected referred | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH174a - CBS alerts with timely response | CBS alerts responded to within 24 hours or within specified time period from the CBS protocol | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH174b - CBS alerts | CBS alerts | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH175a - Communities in action after alerts | Communities in which action was taken following an alert (per month) | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH175b - Communities with alert(s) | Communities in which there was at least an alert (per month) | CH - Community-based surveillance (Monthly) | CH - Community-based surveillance |

## 4. Analytics and Indicators { #4-analytics-and-indicators }

Just as for the DEs, in the table below the column “Indicator Groups” provides information about whether the indicator is found in groups other than the CBS indicator group.

| Nom | Description | Numérateur | Dénominateur | Indicator Groups |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CH173 - Events/alert case detected | Number of events/alert case detected | Events/alert case detected | 1 | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH174b - CBS alerts | Number of CBS alerts | Alerts | 1 | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH175b - Communities with alerts | Number of communities with alerts | Communities with alerts | 1 | CH - Community-based surveillance |
| CH175 - Communities in action after alerts (%) | Proportion of communities in which action was taken following an alert (per month) | Communities with action was taken after an alert | Communities with 1+ alert (per month) | CH - Community-based surveillance |

## 5. Dashboards { #5-dashboards }

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Community-based surveillance”.

The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities. ![Dashboard](resources/images/chis-cbs-db-001.png)
