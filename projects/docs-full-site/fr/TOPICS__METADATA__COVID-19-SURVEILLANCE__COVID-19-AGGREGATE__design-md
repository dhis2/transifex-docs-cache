# COVID-19 Surveillance - Aggregate System Design Guide { #c19-agg-design }

## Objectif { #purpose } 

The COVID-19 Surveillance Aggregate System Design document provides an overview of the design principles and guidance used to develop the digital data package for aggregate COVID-19 surveillance. This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localisation of the package. The COVID-19 metadata package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines. In particular, local work flows and national guidelines should be considered in the localization and adoption of the programs included in this package.

## Contexte { #background } 

This aggregate design has been updated to reflect new aggregate reporting requirements from the [Global surveillance of COVID-19: WHO process for reporting aggregated data](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/aggregated-weekly-reporting-form), last updated on August 7, 2020. The COVID-19 digital data package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing COVID-19 data. UiO has developed COVID-19 surveillance packages for three types of data models (tracker, event-based aggregate) to enable countries to select the model that is most appropriate for their context given the burden of disease and available resources. These models and their relative benefits/limitations are summarized below:

| **Type de Package de surveillance** | **Surveillance basée sur les cas (Tracker)** | **Case surveillance line-listing (Event)** | **Surveillance des cas (Agrégat )** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Enrolls a case and tracks over time through laboratory confirmation & case outcome | Permet de saisir les détails relatifs à un cas critique sous forme de liste de lignes | Enables weekly reporting of key aggregate data points |
| **Avantages** | La grande granularité des données et les multiples dimensions temporelles de l'analyse peuvent permettre de décentraliser le flux de travail c'est-à-dire tous les événements liés au cas. | Caractéristique plus granulaire qu'agrégée et pouvant saisir les principales dimensions temporelles (c'est-à-dire la date du rapport par rapport à l'apparition des symptômes) ; réduction de la charge de saisie des données par rapport au tracker et niveau de complexité peu élevé | Peu complexe, facile à mettre en œuvre, plus facile à gérer lorsque le nombre de cas est élevé |
| **Inconvénients** | Le volume de données à saisir peut être écrasant lorsque le nombre de cas atteint le seuil ; ceci peut rendre la mise en œuvre complexe | Ne prend pas en charge le suivi des cas ou d'autres flux de travail décentralisés | Une granularité plus faible pour l'analyse détaillée (c'est-à-dire une analyse basée exclusivement sur la date de notification du cas, une désagrégation limitée)|

**This document covers only the design of the aggregate package**; separate system design documents are available for DHIS2 Tracker and Line-listing (event-based) packages. As cases increase rapidly, some countries may struggle with case-based reporting as the burden becomes too high. The aggregate package is designed to meet the most critical reporting requirements and analytical capacities for surveillance and response.

Les objectifs du progiciel de surveillance du COVID-19 sont les suivants :

1. surveiller les tendances de la maladie là où il y a transmission interhumaine ;
2. détecter rapidement les nouveaux cas dans les pays où il n'y a pas de circulation du virus ;
3. fournir des informations épidémiologiques pour effectuer des évaluations des risques aux niveaux national, régional et mondial ; et
4. fournir des informations épidémiologiques pour orienter les mesures de préparation et d'intervention.

The system design builds upon existing disease surveillance principles and information system requirements that have been developed collaboratively between the WHO and UiO since 2017. The COVID-19 package was developed with the intent to align to [WHO technical guidance on nCoV-19 surveillance and case definitions](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions), last updated August 7, 2020. Note that this design may not necessarily reflect the latest available interim global guidance developed by WHO as updates may be released rapidly. National guidelines and policies may vary and it is recommended to adapt this package to local context.

## Résumé de la conception du système { #system-design-summary } 

In the development of this configuration package, an effort has been made to follow UiO&#39;s [general design principles](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/metadata/dhis2-who-digital-health-data-toolkit/general-design-principles-for-who-metadata-packages.html) and a common [naming convention](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/metadata/dhis2-who-digital-health-data-toolkit/naming-conventions.html).

The aggregate COVID-19 surveillance package includes

1. Weekly aggregate data set and data elements for key COVID-19 surveillance reporting
2. Categories for data disaggregation
3. Core indicators
4. Tableau de bord et ses items

The dataset captures a minimum number of data points that meet the current WHO weekly reporting requirements; and generate a core set of indicators and dashboards for national and sub-national decision-makers to rapidly analyze and respond to disease trends.

| **Nom** | **Périodicité** | **Objectif** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aggregate Weekly Surveillance | Hebdomadaire| Reporting of key COVID-19 surveillance data including cases, tests and deaths. |

It is recommended that the weekly dataset is assigned to Organisation Units at the lowest level of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as health facilities.

Digital data packages are optimized for Android data collection with the DHIS2 Capture App, free to download on the [GooglePlay store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhis2&amp;hl=en).

### Utilisateurs cibles { #intended-users } 

- Health facility users: capture and report key data on COVID-19 cases and deaths presenting at the health facility
- Surveillance officers: surveillance officers at national and sub-national level may be responsible for supporting data entry and analysis.
- Autorités sanitaires nationales et locales : suivi et analyse des données de surveillance des maladies au moyen de tableaux de bord et d'outils d'analyse permettant de réaliser des évaluations des risques et de planifier les interventions ; production de rapports en vue des rapports régionaux et global

## Ensembles de données { #datasets } 

This dataset is intended to capture weekly data needed for rapid response to disease transmission. If the burden of reporting becomes too great or when it is no longer considered an emergency situation in the country, the data set may be changed to monthly according to MOH policies.

### Daily Surveillance Data Elements { #daily-surveillance-data-elements } 

The following lists the data elements and disaggregation (category combinations) included in the data set:

| **Éléments de données** | **Category Combinations** |

### Weekly Surveillance Data Entry Form { #weekly-surveillance-data-entry-form } 

- **Section 1: New confirmed and probable Cases**

Data should be entered for all new confirmed and probable cases reported during the reporting period. Confirmed cases refer to laboratory confirmed cases per WHO guidance; probable cases are defined by WHO as cases where laboratory test result is inconclusive; however countries may apply their own case definitions. The total column is automatically summed during data entry.

- **Section 2: New confirmed and probable deaths**

Data should be entered for new confirmed and probable deaths reported during the reporting period. The total column is automatically summed during data entry.

![Picture2](resources/images/AGG_Picture2.png)

- **Section 3: Health worker infection and death**

This section captures data for health workers&#39; new confirmed and probable cases including deaths reported during the reporting period.

### Personnalisation des formulaires de saisie de données { #customizing-data-entry-forms } 

The dataset in this package does not contain a custom form. To improve the usability of the form for data entry, implementers may design a custom form to meet their needs by following the DHIS2 User manual: [https://docs.dhis2.org/2.33/en/user/html/dhis2\_user\_manual\_en\_full.html#manage\_customform](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/configuring-the-system/metadata.html#manage_customform)

## Data Validation { #data-validation } 

The following data validation rules have been configured. These validation rules do not run in the data entry form itself as it is anticipated that the urgent reporting of data where events occur in different time frames (e.g. one week can see only 3 new cases but 5 deaths).

| **Nom** | **Opérateur** | **Instruction** | **Left side description** | **Right side description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| COVID19 - PCR tests \&lt;= tested | less\_than\_or\_equal\_to | Tested with PCR should be less than or equal to total tests conducted | Tested with PCR | Tested conducted |
