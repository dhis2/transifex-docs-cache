# CHIS - Clean Energy { #chis-agg-ene-design }

## 1. Datasets { #1-datasets } 

### 1.1. Configuration Summary { #11-configuration-summary } 

The aggregate CH - Clean energy (CE) module includes:

1. A yearly dataset for the follow up of key annual information on Clean Energy
2. Core indicators for the dataset
3. A predefined “CH - Clean energy” dashboard

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units at the lowest level of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements { #12-data-elements } 

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the CE module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the CE module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details { #2-dataset-details } 

### 2.1. Clean Energy { #21-clean-energy } 

The section is set to collect the information necessary to identify the different sources of energy used in the surveyed households for cooking, heating, and lighting. The cooking data are disaggregated by source (solar, electric stove, piped natural gas, biogas, LPG/cooking gas, liquid fuel, other). The heating data are disaggregated by type (central heating, cookstove, heat pump, other). The lighting data are disaggregated by source of power (electricity, solar power, rechargeable flashlight, mobile, torch/lantern, battery powered flashlight, biogas lamp, LPG lamp, other).

## 3. Validation Rules { #3-validation-rules } 

There are no validation rules configured for the Clean Energy module.

## 4. Analytics and Indicators { #4-analytics-and-indicators } 

Just as for the DEs, in the table below the column “Indicator Groups” provides information about whether the indicator is found in groups other than the CE indicator group.

## 5. Dashboards { #5-dashboards } 

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Clean energy”.

The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
