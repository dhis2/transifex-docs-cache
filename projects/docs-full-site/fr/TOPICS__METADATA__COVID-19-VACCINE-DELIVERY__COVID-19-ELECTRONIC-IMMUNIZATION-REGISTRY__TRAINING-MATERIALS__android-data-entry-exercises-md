(to be removed when exercises are shared with participant)

You will need to review these exercises and modify them based on your specific workflow. Areas that may be skipped or modified are noted but this is also meant to be at your discretion to modify, remove or add to freely.

You will need to prepare use cases to be entered into DHIS2 within these exercises. If you have real, previously filled vaccination forms that are routinely used this will be the most ideal solution. If you do not, fill in some forms that can be used during the training. Use the same form that the implementation is using which matches your DHIS2 configuration.

Each exercise refers to an accompanying section within the user manual that has more detailed instructions on a specific task outlined within an exercise and is meant for the learner to take as a job aid after the training is complete. You will need to update the user manual to reflect your configuration before sharing it for use as a job aid during training and within the context of your own implementation.

If you are planning to enter data in real time, please create use-cases for data entry following this process as needed.
