# APK Distribution Web App { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp }
## Overview { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp_overview }

This section focuses on the [APK Distribution Web App](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/dff273fc-909e-48af-b151-c4d7e9c8a12c) implementation.

The [APK Distribution Web App](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/dff273fc-909e-48af-b151-c4d7e9c8a12c) enables implementation administrators to manage and control the version of the Android app, making it easier to manage app updates and ensure compatibility with the DHIS2 system. 

Admins will be able to upload the desired version and users will get a prompt message to update when they are not in the last updated version.

Please note that in this version of the Web App, only users with "ALL" authority are able to define the Android app versions. Other users having access to the web app can see the version history list and download the latest version, but cannot edit them.

## Installation { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp_installation }

A user can easily install the Use Case Configuration Web App by logging into the DHIS2 and going to **App Management**.

## Log in and first time setup { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp_webapp_login }

After a user installs and launches the APK Distribution Web App for the first time, the web app will require saving the default values of the configuration. This will allow android devices connect to the instance.
