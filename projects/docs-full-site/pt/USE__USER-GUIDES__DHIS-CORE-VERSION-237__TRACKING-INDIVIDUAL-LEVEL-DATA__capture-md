# Usando o aplicativo Capture { #capture_app } 

## Sobre o aplicativo Capture { #about_capture_app } 

> **Note**
>
> The Capture app serves as a replacement for the Event Capture app. In the future, the Tracker Capture app and the Data Entry app will also be incorporated into the Capture app.

In the Capture app you register events that occurred at a particular time and place. An event can happen at any given point in time. This stands in contrast to routine data, which is captured for predefined, regular intervals. Events are sometimes called cases or records. In DHIS2, events are linked to a program. The Capture app lets you select the organisation unit and program and specify a date when an event happened, before entering information for the event.

## Cadastre um evento { #capture_register_event } 

1. Abra o aplicativo ** Capture **.

2. Selecione uma unidade organizacional.

3. Selecione um programa.

    You will only see programs associated with the selected organisation unit and programs you have access to, and that are shared with your user group through data level sharing.

4. Se o programa tiver uma combinação de categorias definida, a opção de categoria deverá ser selecionada.

5. Clique em ** Novo **.

    ![create new event](resources/images/capture_app/create_new_event.png)

6. Preencha as informações necessárias. Se o estágio do programa de programas estiver configurado para capturar um local:

    - If the field is a coordinate field you can either enter the coordinates
    directly or you can click the **map** icon to the left of the coordinate field.
    The latter one will open a map where you can search for a location or set on
    directly by clicking on the map.

    - If the field is a polygon field you can click the **map** icon to the left of
    the field. This will open a map where you can search for a location and capture
    a polygon (button in the upper right corner of the map).

7. Se desejar, você pode adicionar um comentário clicando no botão ** Escrever comentário ** na parte inferior do formulário.

8. If desired you can add a relationship by clicking the **Add relationship** button at the bottom of the form.
   See the section about **Adding a relationship** for more information.

9. Clique em ** Salvar e sair ** ou clique na seta ao lado do botão para selecionar ** Salvar e adicionar outro **.

    - **Save and add another** will save the current event and clear the form.
    All the events that you have captured will be displayed in a list at the bottom of the page.
    When you want to finish capturing events you can, if the form is blank,
    click the finish button or if your form contains data click the arrow
    next to **Save and add another** and select **Save and exit**.

> **Note**
>
> Some data elements in an event might be mandatory (marked with a red star next to the data element label).
> All mandatory data elements must be filled in before the user is allowed to complete the event.
> The exception to this is if the user has the authority called __"Ignore validation of required fields in Tracker and Event Capture".__
> If the user has this authority, the mandatory data elements will not be required and
> the red star will not be displayed next to the data element label. Note that super user that have the __"ALL"__ authority automatically
> have this authority.

> **Tip**
>
> The data entry form can also be displayed in **row view**. In this mode the data elements are arranged horizontally. This can be
> achieved by clicking the **Switch to row view** button on the top right of the data entry form. If you are currently in **row view** you
> can switch to the default form view by clicking the **Switch to form view** button on the top right of the data entry form.

## Register a tracked entity instance { #register-a-tracked-entity-instance } 

There are two different ways one can register a tracked entity instance under an organisation unit.
The first way, is to register a tracked entity instance without enrolling it to a tracker program.
The second option, is to register a tracked entity instance with program and enroll it. 

### Without a program enrollment  { #without-a-program-enrollment } 

1. Abra o aplicativo ** Capture **.

2. Selecione uma unidade organizacional.

3. Click the "New" button.

    ![image](resources/images/capture_app/register-without-enrollment-new-button.png)

    You'll now be navigated to the registration page. In that page you will see a drop down 
    menu similar to the one in the image below. From the dropdown menu you can select a tracked entity 
    type, eg. Building, Person etc.

    ![image](resources/images/capture_app/register-without-enrollment-dropdown-menu.png)

4. Select the tracked entity type which you want to create a new instance for.

    ![image](resources/images/capture_app/register-without-enrollment-dropdown-menu-with-arrow.png)

5. The moment you select a tracked entity type, a form will be shown on the screen. 

    The "Profile" section will be shown. In this section you can add data relevant to the 
    tracked entity instance. The profile section mainly contains all the tracked entity attributes
    linked to the tracked entity type. 

    ![image](resources/images/capture_app/register-without-enrollment-form.png)

6. Preencha as informações necessárias.

    If the tracked entity type is configured to capture a location:

    - If the field is a coordinate field you can either enter the coordinates
    directly or you can click the **map** icon to the left of the coordinate field.
    The latter one will open a map where you can search for a location or set on
    directly by clicking on the map.

    - If the field is a polygon field you can click the **map** icon to the left of
    the field. This will open a map where you can search for a location and capture
    a polygon (button in the upper right corner of the map).

7. Click the **Save new** button to register the tracked entity instance.

8. You will now be prompted to the tracked entity instance dashboard. 

    The dashboard will show relevant information about the newly created tracked entity instance.

### With a program enrollment { #with-a-program-enrollment } 

1. Abra o aplicativo ** Capture **.

2. Selecione uma unidade organizacional.

3. Select a tracker program of your choice similar to the image below.

    ![create new event](resources/images/capture_app/register-and-enroll-program-selection.png)

4. Click the "New" dropdown button and then click the first option. 

    The first option will look something similar to the image below. 
    The text in our example is "New person in Child programme". 
    Clicking this option will prompt you to the registration and enrollment 
    page of the program you selected. 
    ![create new event](resources/images/capture_app/register-and-enroll-dropdown-button-new-person-in-program.png)

5. Now, you will be able to see a form similar to the image below. 

    The enrollment form has different layouts depending on how the program is customized. The top section has the title "Enrollment",
    and it holds all the relevant information about the enrollment details. This section will always be present, regardless of layout.
    Underneath, the different data input fields relevant to the tracked entity instance will be displayed. 
    These fields will either be displayed within sections or as a completely custom form. 
    The sections, or custom form, mainly contains all the tracked entity attributes linked to the program or tracked entity type.

      ![create new event](resources/images/capture_app/register-and-enroll-form.png)

6. Fill in the required information for the enrollment.
    If the tracked entity type is configured to capture a location:

    - If the field is a coordinate field you can either enter the coordinates
    directly or you can click the **map** icon to the left of the coordinate field.
    The latter one will open a map where you can search for a location or set on
    directly by clicking on the map.

    - If the field is a polygon field you can click the **map** icon to the left of
    the field. This will open a map where you can search for a location and capture
    a polygon (button in the upper right corner of the map).

7. Click **Save new** to register the tracked entity instance.

8. You will now be prompted to the tracked entity instance dashboard. 

    The dashboard will show relevant information about the newly created tracked entity instance.

### Enrollment with auto generated events  { #enrollment-with-auto-generated-events } 

A program can be configured to have zero or more program stages which are automatically generated upon a new enrollment. 
These stages will be auto generated based on the metadata configuration, as explained below.

To configure the auto generation of an event you need to take the following steps. 
1. Open the maintenance app

2. Select the Program tab
![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-01.png)

3. Select a Tracker program
![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-02.png)

4. Select the Program stages tab
![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-03.png)

5. Click on the stage you would like to configure
![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-04.png)

6. Mark the stage as Auto-generated
![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-05.png)

Now, for every new enrollment in this program one event will be auto generated. One program can also have multiple stages marked as auto generated.
For all the auto generated events 

 a) the organisation unit will be the same as the user is reporting for, during the enrollment and 

 b) all the events will be part of the current enrollment. 

Based on configuration, the status of the auto generated event can either be ACTIVE or SCHEDULE.

#### Active type of event { #active-type-of-event } 

If the stage has the "Open data entry form after enrollment" selected, then the event will be generated into the ACTIVE status. Also its execution date will be calculated for the event, in addition to a due date.
The generation happens based on either the enrollment date or the incident date. You can choose the reporting date from the dropdown menu "Report date to use".
![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-06.png)

As shown in the image you have three options, a) Incident date b) Enrollment date or c) No value. 
Choosing reporting date as "Incident date" indicates that both the event execution date and due date will be the same as the incident date.
Choosing reporting date as either "Enrollment date" or "No value" indicates that both the event execution date and due date will be the same as the enrollment date.

#### Schedule type of event { #schedule-type-of-event } 

When the "Open data entry after enrollment" is not checked, it means that the event generated will be a SCHEDULE event. 
The scheduled event does not have an execution date, but only a due date. The due date for these future events are calculated based on either enrollment date or incident date. If the flag below is checked, the reference date is the enrollment date, if the flag is not checked, the incident date is used.
![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-07.png)

When there is no incident date, the reference date will fall back on the enrollment date regardless of whether the flag above is checked.

On SCHEDULE type of events the user can also configure the "Scheduled days from start". Which means if a stage has a number in "Scheduled days from start" the reference date will increased by that number. 
In the example below we increase the due date by 30 days.

![](resources/images/capture_app/auto-generated-08.png)

When the "Scheduled days from start" does not contain a number or contains 0 the reference date is used without adding any days to it.


### Possible duplicates detection { #possible-duplicates-detection } 

In both cases of registering a tracked entity instance, (with enrollment or without enrollment) the system will start looking for possible duplicates.
Note that, programs need to be correctly configured through the maintenance app for the system to start detecting duplicates when enrolling a new person in a program. 

To configure a program through the maintenance app you will have to: 


1. Open the maintenance app.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-maintenance-config-00.png)

2. In the program section select your program. We select Child Programme for this example.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-maintenance-config-01.png)

3. Select the Attributes tab.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-maintenance-config-02.png)

4. Enable duplicates search by checking program attributes as searchable
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-maintenance-config-03.png)


The attributes you have selected as "Searchable" will be the ones which the system will use to detect possible duplicates against.  
Let us explain this with an example that demonstrates the detection of possible duplicates while enrolling a child in the Child Programme. 

1. Abra o aplicativo ** Capture **.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-on-creation-00.png)

2. Select your organisation unit and program from the menu on the top.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-on-creation-01.png)

3. Click "New" -> "New person in Child Programme"
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-on-creation-02.png)

4. Fill in the first name in the form. **Remember, the first name we have checked as "Searchable" in the maintenance app.** 
Click **Save new**. The system will start looking for possible duplicates that match the name Sarah.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-on-creation-03.png)

5. The system will automatically show a list of possible duplicates if there are any. 
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-on-creation-04.png)

6. You can choose to make a new enrollement by clicking **Save new** or if you see the right person in the list - you can view the dashboard.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-on-creation-05.png)

> **Tip**
>
> You can configure duplicates detection for tracked entity types the same way as we did for programs. 


### Program rules execution { #program-rules-execution } 

In both cases of registering a tracked entity instance, (with enrollment or without enrollment) the system will run program rules you have configured.
Note that, rules can be configured in the maintenance app.

To see a rule being executed while enrolling a tracked entity instance you will have to take the following steps. 

1. Configure a rule in the maintenance app. For the example below we configured a rule that throws a warning when the date of birth is less than a year.

2. Abra o aplicativo ** Capture **.
![](resources/images/capture_app/duplicates-on-creation-00.png)

3. Select your organisation unit and program from the menu on the top.
![](resources/images/capture_app/program-rules-on-creation-00.png)

4. Fill in the date of birth with a value which is less than a year. In our case this is 27th of January 2021. 
![](resources/images/capture_app/program-rules-on-creation-01.png)

5. You will now be able to see the warning produced by the program rule underneath the birth date field. 
![](resources/images/capture_app/program-rules-on-creation-02.png)


## Adicionando um relacionamento { #capture_add_relationship } 

Relationships can be added either during registration, editing or viewing of an event.
Currently the **Capture App** only supports *Event to Tracked Entity Instance* relationships.

1. Durante um evento, clique em ** Adicionar relacionamento **.

2. Selecione o tipo de relacionamento que deseja criar.

You now have two options: 

- **Link to an existing Tracked Entity Instance** or 

- **Create new Tracked Entity Instance**.

![relationship options](resources/images/capture_app/relationship_options.png)

### Link para uma instância de entidade rastreada existente { #link-to-an-existing-tracked-entity-instance } 

1. Clique em ** Link para uma Instância de Entidade Rastreada existente **.

- You will be presented with some options for searching for a **Tracked Entity Instance**.
  You have the option to select a **program**. If a **program** is selected the attributes are derived from the selected **program**.
  If no **program** is selected, only the attributes that belong to the **Tracked Entity Instance** will be visible.

    ![search for Tracked Entity Instance](resources/images/capture_app/search_tei.png)

    - If the **Tracked Entity Instance** or **program** is configured with a unique attribute, this attribute can be
      used for finding a specific **Tracked Entity Instance** or **program**. This attribute should be presented alone.
      When the unique attribute field has been filled out, click the **Search** button located right below
      the unique attribute field.

    - If the **Tracked Entity Instance** or **program** has attibutes these can be used for searching by expanding the **Search by attributes** box.
      When all desired attribute fields have been filled out, click the **Search by attributes** button located at the bottom. You can also limit the search by setting the **Organisation unit scope**. If set to *All accessible* you will search for the **Tracked Entity Instance** in all organisation units you have access to. If you select *Selected*, you will be asked to select which organisation units to search within.

2. After a successful search you will be presented with a list of **Tracked Entity Instances** matching the search criteria.
   To create a relationship click the **Link** button on the **Tracked Entity Instance** you would like to create a relationship to.

- If you did not find the **Tracked Entity Instance** you were looking for, you can either click the **New search** or **Edit search** buttons.
  **New search** will take you to new blank search while **Edit search** will take you back to the search you just performed keeping the search criteria.

### Criar uma nova instância de entidade rastreada { #create-new-tracked-entity-instance } 

1. Clique em ** Criar nova instância de entidade rastreada **.

- You are now presented with a form for registering a new **Tracked Entity Instance**. You can choose to either register with or without a program.
  If a program is selected, the new **Tracked Entity Instance** will be enrolled in said program. You can also change the **Organisation unit** by removing the one that is automatically set and selecting a new one.

  ![register new Tracked Entity Instance](resources/images/capture_app/register_tei.png)

2. Preencha os atributos desejados (e possivelmente obrigatórios) e os detalhes de inscrição.

3. Clique em ** Criar instância de entidade rastreada e link **.

> **Note**
>
> When filling in data you might face a warning telling you that a possible duplicate has been found. You can click the warning to see these
> duplicates and if the duplicate is a match you can choose to link that **Tracked Entity Instance** by clicking the **Link** button.
> If the warning is still present when you are done filling in data, you will not see the **Create Tracked Entity Instance and Link** button.
> Instead you will be presented with a button called **Review duplicates**. When you click this button a list of possible duplicates will be displayed.
> If any of these duplicates matches the **Tracked Entity Instance** you are trying to create you can click the **Link** button, if not you can click
> the **Save as new person** button to register a new **Tracked Entity Instance**.

#### Fallback search { #fallback-search } 

Execute a full search as described above. If the search you have made has results they will be displayed. However, the actual **Tracked Entity Instance** you are searching for may be within a different program. In that case, you may want to extend the search to other programs. This is known as a fallback search.

To execute a fallback search, simply press the button on the bottom saying "Search in all programs".

> **Note**
>
> The fallback search is only possible when searching within a Program.

    In this list you can see the entries that match your search. For each entry you have the option to click the "View Dashboard" button to view the dashboard for the **Tracked Entity Instance**.


### Too many results functionality { #too-many-results-functionality } 

The program or tracked entitiy type you are searching within may be configured with a limit on the number of results that are retrurned from a search. If your search results exceed this limit you will be shown a warning message like the one below.

![](resources/images/capture_app/search-by-attributes-on-scope-program-overview-too-many-results-message.png)

### Pagination { #pagination } 

The results page shows up to five results at a time. You should try to use specific search criteria so that there are not too many matches. However, if there are more than five results, you can see the next results by using the **>** button at the end of the page.

![](resources/images/capture_app/search-by-attributes-on-scope-program-overview-pagination.png)

## List tracked entity instances enrolled in program { #list-tracked-entity-instances-enrolled-in-program } 

1. Abra o aplicativo ** Capture **.

2. Selecione uma unidade organizacional.

3. Select a tracker program.

4. The program can have categories associated with it (implementing partner would be an example of such a category). If this is the case, fill them in.

### Filter the list { #filter-the-list } 

Use the buttons above the list itself to filter it.

![](resources/images/capture_app/tei_list_filters.png)

As an example, you could filter the list to show only tracked entity instances where you have been assigned an event: Click the "Assigned to" filter (1), select "Me" (2) and then "Apply" the changes (3).

![](resources/images/capture_app/tei_list_filter_example.png)

### Sort the list { #sort-the-list } 

Click one of the column headers to sort the list by that column. A small arrow is displayed next to the column header to indicate the current sort order. Click again to change between ascending and descending order.

![](resources/images/capture_app/tei_list_sort_order.png)

### Modify the list layout { #modify-the-list-layout } 

You can select which columns to show in the list and also reorganize the order of the columns.

Click the **gear** icon in the top right corner of the list. Tick the checkboxes for the the columns you would like to display (1) and reorgainze the columns by dragging and dropping (2).

## Implementer / administrator info { #implementer_info } 

### Metadata caching { #metadata_caching } 

For performance reasons the Capture app caches metadata in the client browser. When metadata is updated on the server the changes needs to be propagated to the clients that have already cached the metadata. Depending on the change, this is done in one of three ways:

1. If the change is bound to a program you will need to increase the program version for that particular program. For example, if you change the data elements in a program or a program rule, the version for the bound program needs be increased.

2. If the change is NOT bound to a program you will need to increase ANY program version for the change to be propagated to the clients. Examples here are changes to constants, organisation unit levels or organisation unit groups.

3. The exception to the two rules above is option sets. Option sets have their own version property, i.e. increasing the option set version should ensure the option set metadata are propagated to the clients.
