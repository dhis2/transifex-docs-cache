# Controle de qualidade de dados { #control_data_quality } 

## Sobre verificações de qualidade de dados { #about_data_quality } 

The **Data Quality** app contains tools to validate the accuracy and
reliability of the data in the system. You can assess different dimensions of 
data quality as outlined in the table below: 


| Dimension | Descrição |
|---|---|
| Correctness | Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements. |
| Completeness | Data for all data elements for all reporting organisation units should have been submitted. |
| Consistency | Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent with other similar facilities. |
| Timeliness | All data from all reporting organisation units should be submitted at the appointed time. |

Você pode verificar a qualidade dos dados de diferentes maneiras, por exemplo:

  - At point of data entry, DHIS 2 can check the data entered to see if
    it falls within the minimum maximum value ranges of that data
    element (based on all previous data registered).

  - By defining validation rules, which can be run once the user has
    finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a
    particular period and organization unit(s) against the validation
    rules, and display the violations for these validation rules.

  - Ao analisar conjuntos de dados, ou seja, examine as lacunas nos dados.

  - By data triangulation, that is, comparing the same data or indicator
    from different sources.

## Análise de regra de validação { #validation_rule_analysis } 

### Sobre a análise da regra de validação { #about-validation-rule-analysis } 

A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a numeric relationship
between data element values. The expression forms a condition which
should assert that certain logical criteria are met.

A expressão consiste em:

  - um lado esquerdo

  - um lado direito

  - uma operadora

A validation rule could assert that "Suspected malaria cases tested" \>=
"Confirmed malaria cases".

The left and right sides must return numeric values.

The validation rule analysis tests validation rules against the data
registered in the system. Validation violations are reported when the
condition defined in the validation rule expression is not met, which
means when the condition is false.

You can configure a validation rule analysis to automatically send out
information about validation violations to selected user groups. These
messages are called *validation notifications* and you create them in
the **Maintenance** app. Validation notifications are sent via the
internal DHIS 2 messaging system.

### Fluxo de Trabalho { #workflow } 

1.  In the **Maintenance** app, create validation rules and validation
    rule groups.

2.  (Optional) In the **Maintenance** app, create validation
    notifications.

3.  Execute a análise da regra de validação, automática ou manualmente.

      - In the **Scheduler** app, you schedule the validation
        rule analysis to run automatically for all validation rules
        included in one or several validation rule groups. After the
        system has run the analysis, you'll see the validation
        violations (if any) in the validation notifications sent via the
        internal DHIS 2 messaging system.

      - In the **Data Quality** app, you run the validation rule
        analysis manually for selected validation rules. After the
        analysis process has finished, you'll see a list of validation
        violations (if any).

### Agende uma análise de regra de validação para ser executada automaticamente { #schedule-a-validation-rule-analysis-to-run-automatically } 

> **Note**

6.  (Optional) Select *Persist new results* to persist any non-persisted
    results found during the analysis

7.  Selecione uma ** Unidade organizacional principal **.

8.  Clique em ** Validar **.

    The analysis process duration depends on the amount of data that is
    being analysed. If there are no violations of the validation rules,
    you'll see a message saying *Validation passed successfully*. If
    there are validation violations, they will be presented in a
    list.

## Outlier detection { #outlier_detection } 

### About outlier detection { #about-outlier-detection } 

The outlier detection tool identifies values which are
numerically distant from the rest of the data, potentially indicating that they are outliers.
The analysis is based on the standard normal distribution. DHIS 2 calculates the mean of
all values for an organisation unit, data element, category option
combination and attribute option combination.

> **Note**
>
>  As indicated above, this data quality analysis is only appropriate for 
>  data which is normally distributed. Data with large seasonal
>  variation, or which may be distributed according to other statistical models
>  (e.g. logistical ) may lead values being flagged which actually should be considered valid. 
>  It is therefore recommended to first confirm whether the data actually is normally 
>  distributed before running a standard deviation outlier analysis.

### Run outlier detection { #run-outlier-detection } 

![](resources/images/data_quality/std_dev_analysis.png)

1.  Open the **Data Quality** app and click **Outlier Detection**.

2.  Select one or multiple data sets.

3.  Select **Organisation units**.

    Multiple organisation units can be selected. The analysis is made on raw data for all organisation units in the sub-hierarchy of the selected units, not on aggregated data.

4.  Selecione ** Desde a data ** e ** Até a data **.

5.  Set the **Algorithm** to use. 

    **Z-score** (based on the mean of data values), **Modified Z-score** (based on the median of data values) and **Min-max values** (based on stored min-max data values) are available algorithms.

6. Select a **Threshold**.

   This refers to the number of standard deviations the data is allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an outlier.

7. Select **Max results**.

   This refers to the maximum number of outliers listed in the results.

8. (Optional) Select a **Data start date** and **Data end date**

   These fields can be used to perform outlier detection analysis on a subset of the data within the provided date range. When left blank, the natural start and end date of the dataset will be used _(in advanced section)_.

9. (Optional) Select a measure to **Sort by**.

   The outliers can be sorted by **Z-score** or by **Absolute deviation from Mean** _(in advanced section)_.

10. Click **Start**
    The analysis process duration depends on the amount of data that is    being analysed. If there are standard deviations outliers, they will be presented in a list.
    ![](resources/images/data_quality/std_dev_analysis_outlier_result.png)
    For each outlier, you will see the data element, period, organisation unit, value, z-score, deviation, standard deviation, mean, min, and max. The minimum and maximum values refer to the border values derived from the number of standard deviations selected for the analysis.

11. (Optional) Click **Download as CSV** to download the list in CSV format.

> **Tip**

> Click the checkbox to mark an outlier value for further follow-up.

## Minimum maximum outlier detection { #min_max_outlier_detection } 

### About minimum maximum value based outlier detection { #about-minimum-maximum-value-based-outlier-detection } 

You can verify the data quality at the point of data entry by setting a
minimun/maximum value range for each data value. You can define the value
ranges manually or generate them automatically.

The auto-generated minimum maximum value range is suitable only for
normally distributed data. DHIS2 will determine the arithmetic mean and
standard deviation of all values for a given data element, category
option, organisation unit and attribute combination. Then the system
will calculate the minimum maximum value range based on the **Data
analysis std dev factor** specified in the **System Settings** app.

For data which is highly-skewed or zero inflated (as is often the case
with aggregate data), the values which DHIS2 auto-generates may not
provide an accurate minimum maximum value range. This can lead to
excessive false violations, for example if you analyse values related to
seasonal diseases.

> **Note**
>
> Minimum maximum value ranges are calculated across all attribute
> combination options for a given data element, category option and
> organisation unit combination.

### Fluxo de Trabalho { #workflow } 

1.  Create a minimum maximum value range, either automatically or
    manually.

      - In the **Data Administration** app, you generate value ranges
        automatically.

      - No aplicativo ** Data Entry **, você pode definir intervalos de valores manualmente.

2.  No aplicativo ** Data Quality **, execute a análise ** Min-max outlier **.

### Configure a minimum maximum outlier detection { #configure-a-minimum-maximum-outlier-detection } 

#### Criar intervalo de valor máximo mínimo automaticamente { #create-minimum-maximum-value-range-automatically } 

> **Note**
>
> Auto-generated minimum maximum value ranges can be useful for many
> situations, but it's recommended to verify that the data is actually
> normally distributed prior to using this function.

You generate minimum maximum value ranges calculated by data set in the
**Data Administration** app. The new value ranges override any value
ranges that the system has calculated previously.

1.  Defina o ** fator de desvio padrão da análise de dados (desvio padrão) **:

    1.  Abra o aplicativo ** System Settings ** e clique em ** General **.

    2.  No campo ** Fator de desenvolvimento padrão da análise de dados **, insira um valor.

        This sets the number of standard deviations to use in the
        outlier analysis. The default value is 2. Higher values
        indicate a broader distribution, which may lead to outliers
        not being flagged correctly by the analysis. 

2.  Abra o aplicativo ** Administração de dados ** e clique em ** Geração de valor mínimo-máximo **.

3.  Selecione o (s) conjunto (s) de dados.

4.  Selecione uma ** Unidade organizacional **.

5.  Clique em ** Gerar **.

    New minimum maximum value ranges for all data elements in the
    selected data sets for all organisation units (including
    descendants) of the selected organisation units are generated.

#### Criar intervalo de valor mínimo / máximo manualmente { #create-minimummaximum-value-range-manually } 

![](resources/images/data_quality/set_min_max_manually.png)

1.  No aplicativo ** Data Entry **, abra um formulário de entrada de dados.

2.  Clique duas vezes no campo para o qual deseja definir o intervalo de valor mínimo / máximo.

3.  Insira ** Limite mínimo ** e ** Limite máximo ** na caixa de diálogo que aparece.

4.  Clique em **Salvar**.

    If values don't fall within the new value range the next time you
    enter data, the data entry cell will appear with an orange
    background.

5.  (Optional) Type a comment to explain the reason for the discrepancy,
    for example an event at a facility which may have generated a large
    number of clients.

6.  (Opcional) Clique em ** Salvar comentário **.

> ** Dica **
>
> Clique no ícone de estrela para marcar o valor para acompanhamento posterior.

#### Excluir intervalo de valor máximo mínimo { #delete-minimum-maximum-value-range } 

You can permanently delete all minimum maximum value ranges for selected
data sets and organisation units in the **Data Administration** app.

1.  Abra o aplicativo ** Administração de dados ** e clique em ** Geração de valor mínimo-máximo **.

2.  Selecione o (s) conjunto (s) de dados.

3.  Select an **Organisation unit**. Note, that the selection cascades to 
    descendant organisation units!

4.  Clique em ** Remover **.

### Run a minimum maximum outlier detection { #run-a-minimum-maximum-outlier-detection }

5.  Selecione ** Desde a data ** e ** Até a data **.

6.  Set **Algorithm** to **Min-max values**.

7.  Select **Max results**

    This refers to the maximum number of outliers listed in the results.

8.  Click **Start**

    The analysis process duration depends on the amount of data that is
    being analysed. If there are standard deviations outliers, they will
    be presented in a list.

    ![](resources/images/data_quality/min_max_result.png)

    For each outlier, you will see the data element, period, organisation unit,
    value, deviation, min, and max.
