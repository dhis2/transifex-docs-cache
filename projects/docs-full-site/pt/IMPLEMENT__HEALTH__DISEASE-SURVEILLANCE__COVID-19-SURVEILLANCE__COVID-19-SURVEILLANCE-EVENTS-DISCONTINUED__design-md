# COVID-19 Surveillance Line-list Design { #c19-evt-design }

Demo: [https://covid.dhis2.org](https://covid.dhis2.org/demo)

## Objectivo { #purpose } 

The COVID-19 Surveillance Event Program System Design document provides an overview of the design principles and guidance used to develop the digital data package for aggregate COVID-19 surveillance. This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localisation of the package. The COVID-19 metadata package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines. In particular, local work flows and national guidelines should be considered in the localization and adoption of the programs included in this package.

## Fundo { #background } 

The COVID-19 digital data package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing COVID-19 data. UiO has developed COVID-19 surveillance packages for three types of data models (tracker, event-based aggregate) to enable countries to select the model that is most appropriate for their context given the burden of disease and available resources. These models and their relative benefits/limitations are summarized below:

|Type of Surveillance Package|Case-based Surveillance (Tracker)|Surveillance (Event)|Surveillance (Aggregate)|
|--|--|--|--|
|_Description_|Enrolls a case and tracks over time through laboratory confirmation & case outcome|Captures critical case details in line-listing format|Enables daily or weekly reporting of key aggregate data points|
|_Pros_|Highly granular data and multiple time dimensions for analysis, can support decentralized workflow, all events linked to the case|More granular than aggregate and can capture key time dimensions (i.e. report date vs onset of symptoms); reduced burden of data entry compared to tracker and little complexity|Low complexity, easy to implement, most manageable when cases numbers are high|
|_Cons_|Burden of data entry may be overwhelming when number of cases reach threshold; complexity of implementation|Does not support case-follow up or other decentralized workflows|Less granularity for detailed analysis (i.e. analysis only based on case reporting date, limited disaggregation)

**This document covers only the design of the surveillance event program package**; separate system design documents are available for DHIS2 Tracker and aggregate packages.

A OMS está “instando todos os países a se prepararem para a chegada potencial do COVID-19, preparando sistemas de resposta a emergências; aumento da capacidade de detectar e cuidar de pacientes; garantir que os hospitais tenham espaço, suprimentos e pessoal necessário; e desenvolver intervenções médicas que salvam vidas. ”

Os objetivos da vigilância COVID-19 são:

1. Monitorar tendências da doença onde ocorre transmissão humano a humano;
2. Detectar rapidamente novos casos em países onde o vírus não está circulando;
3. Fornecer informações epidemiológicas para realizar avaliações de risco aos níveis nacional, regional e global; e
4. Fornecer informações epidemiológicas para orientar as medidas de preparação e resposta.

The system design builds upon existing disease surveillance principles and information system requirements that have been developed collaboratively between the WHO and UiO since 2017. The COVID-19 package was developed with the intent to align to [WHO technical guidance on nCoV-19 surveillance and case definitions](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions), last updated March 20, 2020. Note that this design may not necessarily reflect the latest available interim global guidance developed by WHO as updates may be released rapidly. National guidelines and policies may vary and it is recommended to adapt this package to local context.

## Resumo do  Desenho do Sistema { #system-design-summary } 

This package is designed as a DHIS2 [Event Program](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/configuring-the-system/programs.html#about_event_program). **The Event Program is not designed to capture all data variables contained in the [WHO case reporting template](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/2020-02-27-data-dictionary-en.xlsx)**. To capture a complete set of WHO case reporting variables, please refer to the DHIS2 COVID-19 Case-based Surveillance Tracker. Rather, the event program is a simplified program that captures a subset of minimum critical data points to facilitate high data quality when the number of caseloads or burden of reporting exceeds capacity for successfully completing the full line-list for suspected COVID-19 cases. For implementers who wish to capture the complete WHO line-listing, please refer to the COVID-19 Case-based Surveillance Tracker Package.

The COVID-19 Surveillance Event Program data package includes:

1. Event program and data elements case reporting
2. Core indicators
3. painel de controle

### Use Case: Simplified line-listing of COVID-19 cases { #use-case-simplified-line-listing-of-covid-19-cases } 

As cases increase rapidly, some countries may struggle with case-based reporting as the burden becomes too high. The event package is designed to capture the most critical data points in a line-list and analytical capacities for surveillance and response. The event package is designed as a standalone program. However, countries may use the event package in combination with other packages (i.e. event reports and daily aggregate reporting); or, they may shift from tracker to event to aggregate as caseloads and reporting burden increases. **_Countries should plan carefully how they intend to implement these packages in combination, including reporting flows, transitioning from one data model to another, and how to maintain historical data for analysis if transitioning between data models.   _**

O design do programa de listagem linear baseado em eventos pressupõe que [definições de caso da OMS] (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331506/WHO-2019-nCoV-SurveillanceGuidance-2020.6-eng.pdf) são seguidos no caso de uso; os países devem seguir as definições de caso nacionais para classificar os casos como suspeitos, prováveis ou confirmados.

#### Usuários pretendidos { #intended-users } 

* Health facility users: capture and report key data on COVID-19 cases and deaths presenting at the health facility
* Autoridades nacionais e locais de saúde: monitorar e analisar dados de vigilância de doenças por meio de painéis e ferramentas de análise para conduzir avaliações de riscos e planejar medidas de resposta; gerar relatórios para relatórios regionais e globais

#### Fluxo de Trabalho { #workflow } 

Unlike the tracker program, there are limitations to decentralization of the data reporting workflow in an Event program. The most significant limitation is that the Case Outcome (recovery or death) is often not known until days or weeks after the case is reported. The current program design allows for the following workflow options:

1. Event is created when a suspected case is reported. All known data is entered, but the event is not completed. A user can select an ‘Active Event’ from a working list based on User filters and criteria. When missing data becomes available (i.e. the case outcome), the user can enter the remaining data fields and complete the event. Cases can be identified in the event list by the Case ID data element. See the image below as an example which can be accessed within the Capture App:
![Capture App](resources/images/EVENT_image1.png "Capture App")

2. O evento é criado. Todos os dados relacionados ao caso são inseridos retrospectivamente, incluindo o Resultado. O evento está concluído. _A limitação é que essa abordagem é a oportunidade dos relatórios de dados, uma vez que novos casos suspeitos podem não ser capturados até seu resultado, que geralmente é tarde demais para a tomada de decisão._

### Program Structure { #program-structure } 

The program is called ‘COVID-19 Cases (events)’

|Section|Descrição|
|--|--|
|Date of report|Event Date<br>_Countries may re-name the event date to apply to their protocols._|

Initially, it is the report date. If the date of onset of symptoms is available, the date is replaced by the date of onset of symptoms.|
|**Status**|**This is a generic field included in all Event Program**<br>**Complete event**<br>Option: Yes<br>The event should only be marked as ‘complete’ if all data entry has been completed. If the user is waiting to complete certain fields (such as case outcome), the event should be left not complete.<br>Events that are not marked as ‘Complete’ are maintained as active and can be more easily searched by the user in a working list|
|Section 9<br>**Comments**|- **Comments**<br>Optional comments and remarks. Note that these comments will not display in the analytics and can only be accessed through the Capture app used to enter line-listed data.|

### User Groups { #user-groups } 

The following user groups are included in the metadata package:

1. COVID19 admin -- intended for system admins to have metadata edit rights
2. COVID19 data capture -- intended for data entry staff to have access to capture data
3. COVID19 access -- intended for users such as analytics users who should be able to view the data, but not edit metadata. 

Currently, only users assigned to the COVID19 data capture group will have access to capture data in the program.  Please refer to the installation guidance for more instructions.

### Indicators and Program Indicators { #indicators-and-program-indicators } 

From the data captured in the COVID-19 line-listing program, we can calculate the following indicators, including those recommended by the WHO for daily and weekly reporting, present them in a dashboard. All COVID-19 program indicators based on the event program are assigned to the Program Indicator Group ‘COVID-19 Events.’
