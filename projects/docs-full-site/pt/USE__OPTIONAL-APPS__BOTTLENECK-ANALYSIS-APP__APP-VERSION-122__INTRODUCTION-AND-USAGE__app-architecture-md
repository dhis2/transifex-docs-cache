# Arquitetura do aplicativo BNA { #bna-app-architecture } 

The BNA Application is built on architecture that eases the user
interactions by having a design concept that promotes the user to follow
their intuition complemented with high performance that considers the
lowest internet connection scenarios with descriptive notification
messages if the user misses a step along the way.

## Conceitos de design de aplicativos BNA { #bna-app-design-concepts } 

### Faça mais com menos etapas { #do-more-with-less-steps } 

Most of the operations in the application can be achieved in three steps
or less. The BNA App gives a district user or any user at any level with
no administrative privilege the ability to perform operations without a
need to switch between modules or drop ongoing activities. Users can
bookmark interventions, filter interventions by organization unit or
period and more with everything being just a click away.

### Confie na sua intuição { #trust-your-intuition } 

The BNA App has been built from the ground app, to make functionalities
more accessible, more intuitive and most importantly more capable. The
App follows a minimalistic design that minimizes any chances of the user
getting lost in the middle of performing their usual operations.

## Layout do aplicativo BNA { #layout-of-the-bna-app } 

The BNA App is flexible to adapt to any number of user journeys depending on the
country's implementations. The primary two users are:

1. ___Administrators:___ can manage interventions with operations such as creating
   interventions, applying data filters for interventions, making legend definitions
   and many more administrative operations.
2. ___District users:___ analyzing the bottlenecks can switch through their
   interventions, bookmark their favorite interventions and perform root cause
   analysis through the root cause analysis widget.

Other bottleneck App users can be national, and regional/counties  users who
can only analyse bottlenecks, sub-nation analysis, route causes for each
bottleneck and their solutions.

## Menu DHIS2 global { #global-dhis2-menu }

## Lista de intervenções { #interventions-list } 

Ao carregar a App do BNA, o utilizador terá acesso às intervenções disponíveis e opção de procurar mais intervenções que poderão não ser apresentadas no carregamento. O acesso às intervenções partilhadas é limitado ao nível de acesso em que são partilhadas.

## Filtros globais de intervenções { #interventions-global-filters } 

Right under the interventions list there are controls for the active
interventions. The filter control when clicked expands to offer the user
an ability to make data selections, period selections, organisation unit
selections, and legend configurations. However, all users except
administrators have access to Period Organisation unit filters only.
More details on these operations can be found on chapter 4 section 4.

## Itens de intervenção { #intervention-items } 

Todas as intervenções na App BNA contêm três itens, a saber:

1. O Gráfico de Análise de Gargalo
2. A Tabela de Análise de Subnível
3. O widget de análise de causa raiz

These intervention items will be empty when an intervention is created.
The administrator is expected to configure the intervention items by
making selections on the global filters. More details on how to
configure interventions can be found on Chapter 4 Section 5. The
district user is expected to enter data into the root cause analysis
widget as explained in the next chapters.
