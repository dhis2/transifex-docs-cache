# COVID-19 Case Surveillance & Contact Tracing Design { #c19-cs-design }

Demo: [https://demos.dhis2.org/covid-19](https://demos.dhis2.org/covid-19)

## Objectivo { #purpose } 

O documento do Desenho do sistema de vigilância COVID-19 fornece uma visão geral do desenho conceptual usado para configurar um pacote de dados digitais COVID-19 no DHIS2. O pacote COVID-19 foi desenvolvido em resposta a uma necessidade expressa dos países de adaptar rapidamente uma solução para gerenciar dados do COVID-19. Este documento destina-se ao uso dos implementadores do DHIS2 em nível nacional e regional para poder oferecer suporte à implementação e localização do pacote. O pacote de metadados COVID-19 pode ser adaptado às necessidades locais e às diretrizes nacionais. Em particular, os fluxos de trabalho locais e as diretrizes nacionais devem ser considerados na localização e adoção dos programas incluídos neste pacote.

## Fundo { #background } 

**This design has been updated to reflect new aggregate reporting requirements from the [WHO interim surveillance guidelines updated March 20, 2020][1]**. The COVID-19 digital data package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing COVID-19 data. UiO has developed COVID-19 surveillance packages for three types of data models (tracker, event-based aggregate) to enable countries to select the model that is most appropriate for their context given the burden of disease and available resources. These models and their relative benefits/limitations are summarized below:

| Type of Surveillance Package | Case Surveillance (Tracker) | Surveillance (Event) | Surveillance (Aggregate) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Description*** | Enrols a case and tracks over time through laboratory confirmation & case outcome | Captures critical case details in line-listing format | Enables daily or weekly reporting of key aggregate data points |
| ***Pros*** | Highly granular data and multiple time dimensions for analysis, can support decentralized workflow, all events linked to the case | More granular than aggregate and can capture key time dimensions (i.e. report date vs onset of symptoms); reduced burden of data entry compared to tracker and little complexity | Low complexity, easy to implement, most manageable when cases numbers are high |
| ***Cons*** | Burden of data entry may be overwhelming when number of cases reach threshold; complexity of implementation | Does not support case-follow up or other decentralized workflows | Less granularity for detailed analysis (i.e. analysis only based on case reporting date, limited disaggregation) |

** Este documento cobre apenas o desenho do pacote de programas do rastreador de vigilância **; documentos de desenho de sistema separados estão disponíveis para pacotes DHIS2 e pacotes agregados.

A OMS está “instando todos os países a se prepararem para a chegada potencial do COVID-19, preparando sistemas de resposta a emergências; aumento da capacidade de detectar e cuidar de pacientes; garantir que os hospitais tenham espaço, suprimentos e pessoal necessário; e desenvolver intervenções médicas que salvam vidas. ”

Os objetivos da vigilância COVID-19 são:

1. Monitorar tendências da doença onde ocorre transmissão humano a humano;
2. Detectar rapidamente novos casos em países onde o vírus não está circulando;
3. Fornecer informações epidemiológicas para realizar avaliações de risco aos níveis nacional, regional e global; e
4. Fornecer informações epidemiológicas para orientar as medidas de preparação e resposta.

The system design builds upon existing case disease surveillance principles and information system requirements that have been developed collaboratively between the WHO and UiO since 2017. The COVID-19 surveillance package was developed with the intent to align to [WHO technical guidance on nCoV-19 surveillance and case definitions][2], updated March 20, 2020. Note that this design may not necessarily reflect the latest available interim global guidance developed by WHO as updates may be released rapidly. National guidelines and policies may vary and it is recommended to adapt this package to local context.

## Resumo do  Desenho do Sistema { #system-design-summary } 

The DHIS2 case surveillance tracker metadata was based on the **[WHO COVID-19 case reporting template][3]** and the mapping of data dictionaries can be accessed at: [DHIS2 CBS tracker metadata WHO line-list data dictionary][4].

In the development of this configuration package, an effort has been made to follow UiO’s [general design principles][5] and a common [naming convention][6].

The COVID-19 digital data package supports surveillance workflows and automated analysis for key components of routine and active surveillance. This package includes a Case Surveillance Tracker and Contact registration & follow-up tracker, which are installed together in the same metadata package. The tracker programs are optimized to be installed with other COVID-19 surveillance packages, including the Points of Entry Screening Tracker and aggregate daily surveillance dataset.

1. **[Use Case 1: COVID-19 Case surveillance tracker][7]**: enrols & tracks suspected cases; captures symptoms, demographics, risk factors & exposures; creates lab requests; links confirmed cases with contacts; and monitors patient outcomes. This package can be installed as a standalone COVID-19 package or can be integrated into a country’s existing integrated disease surveillance & response tracker. Metadata for the case surveillance tracker is aligned with the WHO [COVID-19 surveillance data dictionary][8]

    > n.b. The COVID-19 case tracker can be implemented either as a ‘standalone’ program for COVID-19 specific disease surveillance as described here; or, COVID-19 concepts can be integrated into an existing case surveillance tracker program if one already exists in-country. Please refer to installation and implementation guidance for more details.

1. **[Use Case 2: Contact registration & follow-up][9]**: strengthens active case detection through contact tracing activities, such as identification and follow-up of contacts of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.

Digital data packages are optimized for Android data collection with the DHIS2 Capture App, free to download on the [Google Play store][10].

## Use Case 1: COVID-19 Case surveillance tracker { #use-case-1-covid-19-case-surveillance-tracker } 

The COVID-19 case surveillance tracker can be adapted and used by countries to supplement existing national disease surveillance programs. The basic case surveillance program is designed to:

1. Enroll suspected\* COVID-19 cases (*generally appearing at a health facility, but may be enrolled at other places*)
2. Capture informações importantes sobre o caso suspeito, incluindo dados demográficos e exposições, como sintomas, entre em contacto com um caso previamente confirmado e histórico de viagens
3. Gera solicitações de laboratório
4. Registrar diagnóstico de laboratório
5. Record contacts of a confirmed\*\* or probable\*\*\* case for follow-up
6. Registrar o resultado do caso
7. Facilitar a notificação de casos e a notificação de casos nacionais / regionais / globais
8. Gere painéis e ferramentas de análise para monitorar tendências de doenças e planejar estrategias de resposta

The design of the case tracker program assumes that [WHO case definitions][1] are followed in the use case; its use can be adapted to local case definitions as needed. The WHO case definitions were updated on March 20, 2020 and noted below.

> \* Suspected case: A) a patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; **OR**, B) A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; **OR,** C) A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation.
>
>\*\* Probable case: A) a suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive (inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory) **OR,** B) a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.
>
>\*\*\* Confirmed case: A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

#### Descrição do Programa:COVID-19 Teste de caso, Diagnóstico e resultado { #program-description-covid-19-case-testing-diagnosis-outcome } 

| Stage | Descrição |
|---|---|
| **Enrollment details &amp; Attributes** | The Tracked Entity is the case, which is represented by a Tracked Entity Type of ‘person.’ The *Enrollment date* is the date of registration of the case. The Related programs is *COVID-19 Contact registration &amp; follow-up*. The attributes include the following basic personal information and unique case identifiers: *System Generated Case ID*, *Local Case ID*, *Age*, *First Name*, *Surname*, *Sex*, *Case phone number*, *First Name (parent or care)*, *Surname (parent or carer)*, *Home Address*, *Workplace/school physical address*, *Country of Residence*, *Facility contact number*|
| **Stage 1: Clinical Examination and Exposures** | This stage records a suspected case’s clinical symptoms and exposures including: *Symptoms*, *Pregnancy and underlying conditions*, *Hospitalisation and Isolation*, *Exposures in 14 days prior to symptoms*, *Travel history*, *Contact with confirmed case*. After examination, you can record if the case has been hospitalised or isolated, and information surrounding this. |
| **Stage 2: Lab Request [repeatable]** | The lab request records the reason for testing and other information that a lab needs to process a sample and test it for COVID19. The information provided here can help lab personnel prioritize lab tests when resources are limited. The person entering this data could be the same person who registered the suspected case and recorded the patient’s clinical exam and exposures; or may be other personnel charged with making lab requests. |
| **Stage 3: Lab Results [repeatable]** | The Lab Results stage records the type and results from laboratory testing. It can be done directly at the lab or as secondary data entry. This stage is repeatable as samples for a given case may be tested multiple times (i.e. in the case of an inconclusive laboratory results, a new lab test can be conducted and results recorded). |
| **Stage 4: Health Outcome** | The health outcome records the final outcome of the case: (recovered, not recovered, dead or unknown) including date of discharge or death as applicable. |

## Caso de uso 2: COVID-19 Registo de registo e acompanhamento { #use-case-2-covid-19-contact-registration-follow-up } 

This program can be used in addition to the case surveillance tracker to facilitate the registration and follow-up of contacts of a confirmed case. In this scenario, it is assumed that if any contacts of a confirmed case meet criteria for suspected case and are referred for testing, the case will be enrolled into the COVID-19 Case Surveillance tracker program.

O programa de registro e acompanhamento de contatos registra cada contato de um caso (como descrito no Caso de Uso de Vigilância de Casos COVID-19) como uma nova Instância de Entidade Rastreada (pessoa) e os vincula ao caso no Programa de Vigilância de Casos COVID-19 via um 'relacionamento'. Ele possui um estágio simples e repetitivo de acompanhamento, onde os sintomas e qualquer acompanhamento realizado podem ser registrados.

### Fluxo de trabalho: registro e acompanhamento de contatos { #workflow-contact-registration-follow-up } 

![Worflow of the Contact registration &amp; follow-up](resources/images/sdd-tracker-v3-case2-workflow.png)

### Descrição do Programa: Registro e acompanhamento de contactos { #program-description-contact-registration-follow-up } 

| Stage | Descrição |
|---|---|
| **Enrollment details &amp; Attributes** | The Tracked Entity is represented by a Tracked Entity Type of ‘person.’ The Related program is *COVID-19 Case based surveillance*. The attributes include the following basic personal information and unique case identifiers: *System Generated Case ID*, *Local Case ID*, *First Name*, *Surname*, *Date of birth*, *Age*, *Sex*, *Phone number (local)*, *Home Address*, *Country of Residence* |
| **Stage 1: Follow-Up [non-repeatable]** | This stage is meant to record information related to contact tracing follow up, given that a contact has already been identified. It is divided into two sections: *1. Relation with case*, *2. Exposure Assessment* |
| **Stage 2: Symptoms[repeatable]** | This stage is intended to record symptoms of the case. Follow-up to check on the symptoms of a contact can be repeated until the follow-up period is complete (for example, after 14 days or according to national guidelines). When follow-up period is complete, the enrollment can be ‘completed.’ *1. Symptoms*|

Os contactos são adicionados ao caso de índice usando o menu de relacionamentos no programa de vigilância de casos:

![Profile](resources/images/sdd-tracker-v3-case2-profile.png)

Once you select “Add” from the relationships box, you are able to select the relationship and program and either select an existing person or enroll a new contact using the enrollment stage that appears. This will enroll the contact into the contact registration and follow-up
program.

![Add a relationship](resources/images/sdd-tracker-v3-case2-add-relationship.png)

Contacts that are added will then be listed on the case’s tracker dashboard in the relationship
widget

![Relationships widget](resources/images/sdd-tracker-v3-case2-relationships-widget.png)

Você também pode inscrevê-los separadamente no programa. Após a inscrição, você poderá encontrá-los para o acompanhamento, conforme necessário.
