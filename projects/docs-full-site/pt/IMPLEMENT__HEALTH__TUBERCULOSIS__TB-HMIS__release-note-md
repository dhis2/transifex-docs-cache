# Release Note { #tb-agg-release-note }

## 2.0.0 { #200 } 

This is a major new release of the TB metadata and system design for integrating routine tuberculosis data into national HMIS for analysis. This version is aligned with the latest WHO strategic information guidelines for tuberculosis programmes (2023).

The changes affect the notification and outcomes for first and second-line treatment and the household contacts of the confirmed TB cases.

### New Content { #new-content } 

Metadata changes primarily affect the notification and outcomes for first and second-line treatment, as well as household contacts of confirmed TB cases. 

* **Notification and Outcomes**

  The main changes to the datasets TB - Case notification, TB - Case notification (additional), TB - Treatment outcomes, and TB - Treatment outcomes (second line) datasets include:
  Updated dataset name dataset name for additional yearly notifications. This dataset is considered an annual extension of the routine core quarterly reported information and is therefore called “additional”.

* **TB - Case notification (additional)** (previously called ‘TB - RR/MDR case detection and treatment’

   Updated metadata (new, older and legacy) names to conform with updated WHO nomenclature for:
      - **Recurrent** cases (previously referred to as ‘relapsed’)
      - **Re-registered** cases (previously referred to as ‘retreated’)
      - **New episode** cases (previously referred to as ‘new or relapse’)

   Updated data elements to reflect the new guidelines on disaggregation, such as
      - Data Elements for Extrapulmonary, bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed  no longer require a disaggregation by treatment history
      - Additional age disaggregations for TB cases
      - Resistance monitoring classifications (e.g. Isoniazid, fluoroquinolones and bedaquiline susceptibility testing)
      - Treatment history: Lab confirmed RR/MDR-TB now disaggregated by previous treatment history
      - Treatment regimen: DR-TB cohorts are now defined in terms of their regimen length and content

* **TB Prevention - Household (HH) contacts**

   Split previous dataset into two new datasets to ensure precise calculations derived from specific cohorts and analysis periods; and allows for streamlined aggregation of data sourced from the Household Contacts Investigation tracker:
      - Notifications of HH contacts
      - Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT) outcomes

* Elementos de Dados
  Revised disaggregation no longer includes the HIV status of the contacts, but maintains age disaggregation (under or over 5 years old).

All the changes to the metadata are also reflected in the indicators employed for the analysis of the TB - Data Quality dashboard.

## 1.5.0 { #150 } 

The Data Quality (DQ) dashboard and guide are added to the TB HMIS toolkit.

## 1.4.1 { #141 } 

French translations were added to all package components.

## 1.4.0 { #140 } 

Revised package including a new component: Laboratory data set and dashboard.

## 1.1.1 { #111 } 

* Included user group `UKWx4jJcrKt` "TB data capture", which has data capture rights on all data shareable objects (only in the complete package)
* Changed public access sharing to metadata view and data view.
* Removed dashboard `o2Wg6pXAN6X` "TB2.Notifications (rates)", and associated chart `gTcOAYjw4CQ`, pivot table `HCmjOlNONzQ` and map `z4FMNqKG4gl`.
* Updated dashboard layout for use with the new dashboard app (from DHIS 2.29 and above)
* Updated periods in favourites, including data up to and including Q2 2019 (where relevant)
* Minor layout changes to pivot tables `hQ1ksBSIpQr` and `n6ZXdAl1sfD`
* Updated map favourite names
    * Using the built-in translation support for French names rather than having both English and French names.
    * Renamed maps `Eq9lKUQOykM` and `HFi8Oy2fFdJ` from TBm_3.8_... to TBm_3.7_...
    * Renamed maps `b6VznqkP4Hc` and `oA74TkHOKnX` to "TBc_3.5_Ratio of TB cases aged 0-4:5-14 year olds in new and relapse" and "TBc_3.5_Ratio of TB cases aged 0-4:5-14 year olds in new and relapse (annual)"
* Fixed chart `TfeoSE7Ha8F`, changing data dimension from category option group set "Sex" to "Sex (with unknown)"
* Fixed denominator of indicator `whkj4kr4ghD`, should be `#{hKTgk1mG2qn} + #{PdhQ1JCS2ij} + #{M6JHtLJJ34t} + #{KZ7rMA7BqcQ} + #{l4TyT04yP8f} + #{NYxehRdsQx3} +#{QNFhsj0fOxK} + #{Nv1RGi4eI7F} + #{NJaeD9Xia7x} + #{KhCB35MHs9A}`
* Changed description of indicator `p18w24U0caC`
* Changed name, shortName, code and description of indicator `VLtzufVWnHc`
* Fixed 3 validation rules with incorrect formulas:
    * `bDjCyRMtkHO` - New pulmonary smear-positive
    * `VhVCSKuqraP` - New pulmonary smear-negative/smear-unknown/smear not done
    * `hZveAwRhLRh` - New extrapulmonary cases
* Renamed chart `Fw0CsA5Dpvf` (from "TBc_4.3c_Treatment outcomes for DR-TB (%) (annual)" to "TBc_5.5_Treatment outcomes for DR-TB (%) (annual)), and added it to dashboard `xJXvUOEhnE9` ("TB5. DR-TB (annual)").

### Version 1.1.0 { #version-110 } 
* Added three validation rules for the TB/HIV section of the "TB treatment outcomes" data set:
    * `hXd2GANq20y` - "TB/HIV testing (by time of outcome)"
    * `zANh0v8Sbr1` - "HIV-positive TB patients on co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) (by time of outcome)"
    * `EG3H3WrJnKe` - "HIV-positive TB patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (by time of outcome)"
* Fixed three validation rules:
    * `puOMC36U2ad` - "HIV-positive TB patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART)"
    * `MWDQUNd4sZE` - "HIV-positive TB patients on co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT)"
    * `TV3eW5zYLep` - "TB/HIV testing"
* Added two pivot table favourites to complete package only (these are not included in any dashboards):
    * `StXxQoaz26k` - "TBt_0.1_Notifications_all data elements_annual"
    * `dQxhOVtwwK8` - "TBt_0.2_Treatment outcomes_all data elements_annual"
* Fixed two charts where the indicator selection was empty. Both charts should have indicator `VLtzufVWnHc` "TB - New and relapse TB cases by age and sex" selected as data, and the data dimension should be set to "filter":
    *  `TfeoSE7Ha8F` - "TBc_1.2_New and relapse cases by age group and sex"
    *  `VBUUGBP8RFn` - "TBc_1.2_New and relapse cases by age group and sex (annual)"
* Fixed several indicators, including names, descriptions and formulas:
