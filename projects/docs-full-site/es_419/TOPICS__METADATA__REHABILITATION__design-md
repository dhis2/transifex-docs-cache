# Rehabilitation System Design { #rehab-agg-design }

![](resources/images/rehab_logo-en.png){ .center }

## Introducción { #introduction } 

Global trends in health and ageing signal the need for a major scaling up of rehabilitation services in countries around the world and in low- and middle-income countries in particular. Investment in rehabilitation allows people with a health condition to achieve and maintain optimal functioning, by improving their health and by increasing their participation in life. Strengthening rehabilitation in health systems is fundamental to responding to the increasing demand and ensuring that rehabilitation is available and affordable for those who require it. As recommended by the [WHO Rehabilitation 2030 initiative, A Call for Action](https://www.who.int/initiatives/rehabilitation-2030), a key action to strengthen rehabilitation is to collect data relevant to rehabilitation to enhance health information systems (HIS).

The data that are collected through routine rehabilitation health facility reporting, both from individual records and service records, are used to gather information for defining rehabilitation targets and outcomes, clinical decision-making, estimates of service utilization, and quality management. Regular monitoring of rehabilitation services at national and subnational level provides information about their availability and distribution which may inform measures that are taken to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). System level rehabilitation data and information on functioning underpin rehabilitation decision-making in health policy, management and clinical care. Information on functioning is essential to decision-making in rehabilitation at all levels of the health system since the goal of rehabilitation is to optimize functioning in light of impairments, injuries, and acute or chronic diseases.

## Purpose { #purpose } 

The Rehabilitation Aggregate System Design document provides an overview of the design principles and guidance used to develop the digital data package for aggregate Rehabilitation surveillance. This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localization of the package. The Rehabilitation metadata package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines. In particular, local work flows and national guidelines should be considered in the localization and adoption of the package.

## Antecedentes { #background } 

Rehabilitation service delivery covers a wide range of activities for various health conditions, and it is provided by a multidisciplinary workforce at all administrative levels of healthcare. Rehabilitation indicators for routine health facility reporting cover the common types of rehabilitation that are delivered and their relevant features for decision-making both at a system and health facility level. Fully aware of the potential burden of data collection in health facilities, this module uses a general approach in terms of service delivery and does not cover monitoring for specific rehabilitation interventions nor features related to specific intervention types.  

**What are the expected outcomes?**

- The indicators guide the data collected and support the integration of rehabilitation into facility level reporting.

- The analysis framework supports health sector decision making for rehabilitation. It informs the analysis, monitoring and evaluation teams, and allows managers to look at the rehabilitation sector performance, including its integration into the health system, trends of health conditions and rehabilitation service utilization, patterns of quality features, and geographic differences for coverage of service delivery over time. The analysis framework should help program managers and health planners answer rehabilitation M&E questions such as: Are rehabilitation services equipped with adequate resources and where are the gaps? To what extent are rehabilitation services used and what are the features of utilization in relation to service capacity, user’s profile, and service delivery platform? How is rehabilitation contributing to UHC? How does rehabilitation effectiveness evolve in time? How well is rehabilitation integrated into the health system, and along the continuum of care? To what extent do people in need of longer stay, high-intensive, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation have access to quality care?

- Program managers and planners could use the data for the establishment and follow up of real-time measures regarding accessibility, availability, human resources, quality, and service outcome.

- The proposed standard indicators may be used for monitoring purposes of operational and strategic planning for rehabilitation. The data are then collected to track progress towards the objectives of a (national) strategic plan. While the ‘WHO Rehabilitation in Health System – Guide for Action’ document provides guidance for health system strengthening, it contains a section on the monitoring of a rehabilitation strategic plan, called FRAME2. A Rehabilitation Indicators Menu (RIM) with 40 indicators is included for this intent. Of 40 RIM indicators, 11 indicators are collected using data primarily provided by health facilities. As such, these 11 indicators form the basis of the facility indicators list for rehabilitation that are recommended for routine collection by facilities and collated through district health management information systems (DHMIS).

## Usuarios objetivo { #intended-users } 

The information provided through routine data collection and reporting from rehabilitation health facilities needs to be analyzed and used. This is typically done by the following target audience:  

- Ministry of health decision makers such as rehabilitation program managers, data managers and health information system managers;
- Rehabilitation program partners and program planners;  
- Health facility managers for rehabilitation;
- Research institutes involved with the assessment and improvement of rehabilitation data and information systems.  

## Module overview { #module-overview } 

The Rehabilitation aggregate package includes 6 proposed data sets for data collection and 7 dashboards.

### Data sets { #data-sets } 

The data entry forms are logically divided by data collection periods and health care facility types.

#### Bed Density and Incidence Data { #bed-density-and-incidence-data } 

![Bed Density](resources/images/rehab_bed_density_dataset-en.png){ width=50% }

| Facility types         | **All facilities reporting on Rehab (Master Facility List)** |

Rehabilitation occupational groups usually include rehabilitation doctors, rehabilitation nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech language therapists, prosthetists and orthotists, and psychologists. Other rehabilitation occupational groups relevant to the country may also be included, for example audiologists, social workers and mid-level rehabilitation occupational groups. It is also possible to include hospital rehabilitation personnel that are not working for the rehabilitation department. A national health workforce plan typically includes a list of occupational groups for the country and it is recommended to consult this list when establishing the reporting system in the country.

This dataset collects numbers of the following rehabilitation groups at facilities:

1. Rehabilitation doctors
2. Physiotherapists
3. Occupational therapists
4. Speech language therapists
5. Prosthetists/orthotists
6. Psychologists
7. Other personnel

If these figures are already collected in the existing DHIS2 HMIS system, it is possible to replace the proposed data element and all its occurences with the existing element in the system. Please refer to the [installation guide](#rehab-installation) for information on additional configuration of rehabilitation occupational groups data elements and indicators.

### Organisation unit groups { #organisation-unit-groups } 

The Rehabilitation package operates with a set of predefined organisation unit groups. The purpose of these groups is to:

- help the implementers configure the package after importing it into a new or existing DHIS2 instance
- assign the rehabilitation data sets to the relevant organisation unit groups
- utilize the preconfigured dashboards for analysis purposes.

The predifined organisation unit groups are listed in the table below:

| Nombre                         | UID           | Descripción                                                               | Purpose                        |

The Master Facility List for rehabilitation includes those facilities that have a mandate to report on rehabilitation; these commonly include facilities that have rehabilitation workforce, but also facilities that may be providing rehabilitation services/are expected to provide rehabilitation services delivered by non-rehabilitation workforce through task sharing (often primary care facilities).

The Rehab PHC organisation unit group can be further divided into district hospitals and health centres if such disaggregation is relevant for the country.

More information on the configuration of the organisation unit groups, please refer to the [Rehabilitation package installation guide](#rehab-orgunitgroups)

### Indicators { #indicators } 

The configuration of indicators included in the Rehabilitation package is described in more detail in the [Rehabilitation package installation guide](#rehab-indicators)

### Validation rules { #validation-rules } 

To maintain data quality during data collection, the package includes a set of validation rules for the outpatient, inpatient and the Rehab Ward report datasets.

The configuration of these validation rules is described in more detail in the [Rehabilitation package installation guide](#rehab-validation-rules)

### Predictors { #predictors } 

The Rehabilitation package includes a set of predictors that are used to produce data values for rehabilitation occupational groups, rehabilitation master facility list and rehabilitation package availability.

### Dashboards { #dashboards } 

The Rehabilitation module includes 7 dashboards described below.

#### REHAB.01 - Input / Rehabilitation input data { #rehab01-input-rehabilitation-input-data } 

Purpose: The two indicators rehabilitation bed density and personnel density are selected to represent this category as they provide basic information about the availability of core resources needed for essential rehabilitation service provision. They indirectly assess the quality of the rehabilitation service delivery system through the skills set of human resources available in the facilities. Apart from facility program managers, this information is also part of the health system information that health system managers need for the purpose of monitoring, planning and coordination: they need to know whether the rehabilitation beds and health care workers are rightly distributed across health facilities and across programs in order to meet the needs of the target populations.

#### REHAB.02 - Output / Rehabilitation-specific service availability { #rehab02-output-rehabilitation-specific-service-availability } 

Purpose: WHO recommends the availability of an Essential Package (EP) for rehabilitation at Primary Health Care (PHC) level for the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). This indicator measures the percentage of PHC facilities offering 1 or more essential recommended packages (with one as a minimal requirement) and provides information on the status of the implementation of this recommendation in countries. The indicator will list all facilities offering at least 1 of the selected packages, while countries can disaggregate further on the types of essential packages.

#### REHAB.04 - Output / Rehabilitation service quality { #rehab04-output-rehabilitation-service-quality } 

Purpose: Measures of quality and services outcome for dedicated inpatient rehabilitation are particularly interesting for managers. An individualised care plan contributes to better rehabilitation outcomes for clients, and the length of a rehabilitation stay informs assessment of effectiveness and efficiency. Scoring the functioning change over the rehabilitation episode produces a measure of the outcome of the rehabilitation episode. A gain in functioning reflects an increased ability of independent living and societal participation, which is the overall aim of rehabilitation.

#### REHAB.05 - Outcome / Service coverage { #rehab05-outcome-service-coverage } 

Purpose: Coverage is measured through the percentage of people with acute and complex rehabilitation needs who access adequately delivered quality rehabilitation services. Good clinical practice prescribes inpatient multi-disciplinary rehabilitation in a dedicated rehabilitation ward for the effective rehabilitation of a group of health conditions with complex rehabilitation needs. The choice of the health condition to be measured needs to be based on national priorities and the availability of the denominator. In most countries the data source for the denominator (estimated number of people in the country with a defined health condition) will need to be established. It could be a national estimate from a population-based survey or ICD coding. Countries may also make use of the catchment population and apply prevalence estimates for the region to calculate the denominator. For reasons of the availability of the denominator, coverage will only be captured at (sub)national level. If the denominator is unavailable, the analyst can still make use of the "Utilization of people with acute and complex needs" indicator.

#### REHAB.07 - Continuum of care { #rehab07-continuum-of-care } 

Purpose: This section provides information on the rehabilitation sector performance. Rehabilitation is commonly part of a continuum of care and a strong continuum results in better health outcomes. Both rehabilitation referral practice and waiting time are indicative for effective use of the continuum of care. Well-functioning referral processes happen in both directions across the levels of health care, and referrals need to be documented per case to demonstrate effective use of referral process mechanisms. Timely delivery of rehabilitation contributes to its effectiveness and the overall quality of care.
