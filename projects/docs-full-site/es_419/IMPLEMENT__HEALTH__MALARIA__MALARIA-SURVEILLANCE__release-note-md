### New Content { #new-content } 

This release does not include changes to the content. 

### Fixes & Improvements { #fixes-improvements } 

**Common tracker metadata** has been harmonized and aligned with the [DHIS2 Common Metadata Library](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/metadata/dhis2-who-digital-health-data-toolkit/common-metadata-library/design.html) which shares generic concepts across DHIS2 Tracker programs.

**Program Rules**

- Added PR to show 'trimester at enrollment date' for cases enrolled during pregnancy
- Updated PRs for hiding fields based on sex and pregnancy status:
  - [L7XfyMC25Av]: Hide pregnancy status fields when the person is male or the field is blank
  - [hhsVY8oobaz]: Hide pregnancy status and pregnancy months when the person is female and <= 13
  - [fXygq9QkamN]: Hide pregnancy trimeser when the person is female , <= 13, or not pregnant
- Updated PRs to hide sections that are included only for the purpose of assigning values from one program stage to another to produce the desired indicator calculations
  - [DkNSQkPFdRe]: Assign event date to Diagnosis date Data Element - Diagnosis and treatment
  - [LXpKv2W5fi2]: Assign value from Species identified if species has value in diagnosis stage
  - [o1I4C1t0m6x]: Assign value to diagnosis date from previous event - Case Investigation
  - [JizPUKOPn9N]: Assign value to diagnosis date from previous event - Focus routine investigation
  - [I1XWt72FLXX]: Hide section for indicator purposes in Routine (transferred value to a DE in this section from a different stage)

**Relationship types** 

Relationship types 'MAL - Case-to-case' [VgfrHww1dQx] and 'MAL - Case-to-Focus' [dPolzYwmUyN] have been removed from the .json file to improve importability; these are now addressed in the Installation Guide and should be configured in the target system upon import.  

**Sharing settings** for metadata objects have also been updated according to the User Groups and access rights detailed in the System Design Guide. 

## 1.0.1 { #101 } 

Minor metadata compatibility changes.

## 1.0.0 { #100 } 

The Malaria Elimination Case Surveillance & Foci Investigation package supports the [Global technical strategy for malaria](https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789240031357) of transforming surveillance into a core intervention for malaria elimination. The tracker packages supporting case notification, case investigation, foci investigation and classification workflows are designed to be used in conjunction with the aggregate DHIS2 packages for malaria programme monitoring in elimination and burden reduction settings to strengthen data quality, analysis and data-driven decision making.

The package includes two tracker programs intended to work together:
Malaria Case Notification, Investigation & Response program
Malaria Foci Investigation program

The data elements and attributes included follow WHO-recommendations based on global standards and normative guidance as stipulated in the organisations guidelines and guiding documents; in particular, [Malaria Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation: A reference manual](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565578)
