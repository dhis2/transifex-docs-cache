# CH - People-Centered Services { #ch-pcs-aggregate-design }

## 1.Datasets { #1datasets }

### 1.1. Configuration Summary { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - People-centered services (PCS) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for PCS
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on PCS
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - People-centered services” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the PCS module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the PCS module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details { #2-dataset-details }

### 2.1. Monthly PCS Dataset { #21-monthly-pcs-dataset }

#### 2.1.1. Economic and Legal Support { #211-economic-and-legal-support }

The section provides information about the eligible people receiving services and support for economic and legal reasons. The data is disaggregated by age (0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, 15-19y, 20-24y, 25-29y, 30-34y, 35-39y, 40-44y, 45-49y, 50+y, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown). The same info is disaggregableable by condition (HIV, TB, NTDs, Other) - the options should be adapted to better mirror the local context.

#### 2.1.2. Refusal of Health Care { #212-refusal-of-health-care }

The section collects the data on people who decided to refuse health care. The disaggregation is by age (0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, 15-19y, 20-24y, 25-29y, 30-34y, 35-39y, 40-44y, 45-49y, 50+y, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown).

### 2.2. Yearly PCS Dataset { #22-yearly-pcs-dataset }

#### 2.2.1. Economic and Legal Support { #221-economic-and-legal-support }

The section provides the information on people who received economic or legal support and on those who have not received health care according to their health needs.

The disaggregation of data is set by age (0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, 15-19y, 20-24y, 25-29y, 30-34, 35-39y, 40-44y, 45-49y, 50+y) and sex (male, female, other, unknown). The eligible population can be disaggregated also by condition - currently the options are set as HIV, TB, NTDs and Other, but they should be adapted locally according to the context and the activities carried out in the community.

## 5. Dashboards { #5-dashboards }

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - People-centered services”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.

![Dashboard](resources/images/chis-pcs-db-001.png)

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
