# Release Note { #imm-eir-release-note }

## 1.1.0 { #110 } 

### Critical Bug Fixes { #critical-bug-fixes } 

- Upgrade to version 2.36 compatibility
  - Required update on the “Unlock Immunization Schedule” rule
    - Unlock action no longer dependent on minimum number of characters in the unlock justification due to issue with “d2:length” variable in v2.36
- Fixed and standardized HIV+ contraindication program rules 
  - Change made to ProgramRuleVariable to use option code for HIV status

### Features Improvements { #features-improvements } 

1. **Changes to program rule schedule for displaying all eligible doses at every visit**

   - Dose 1 now persists if you mark "no" the first time it is shown
   - Dose 2 is not an option until you have provided dose 1 (assuming you meet other age requirements)
   - Earlier version did not show doses that had been skipped in prior visit(s)

2. **Warning if user unlocks the vaccine schedule and provides response to a previously-provided dose**

3. **Revised the RV2 rule -- age must be after 15 months, and visit 4+ weeks after RV1**

4. **Rubella warning reinstated**

5. **IPV2-4 variables and data elements removed**

6. **Combined warnings for some contraindications if more than one “yes” is selected for the pre-immunization questions regarding HIV+, allergies, and current high temperature**

    - DHIS2 allows only one warning per data element. However for Measles (MCV) and Rotavirus (RV) there is a possibility of multiple contraindication warnings for each dose based on the pre-immunization questions
    - Measles Containing vaccine (MCV) warnings has 2 possible warnings that could be triggered based on the pre-immunization questions: HIV+ and allergy
        - HIV+ and not on ART: *“If the child is HIV+ and showing symptoms of severe immuno-suppression, postpone vaccination until stabilized with ART treatment"*
        - Allergy to Measles vaccine: *“it is contraindicated to give the measles vaccine if the child has had a previous severe allergic reaction to the vaccine.”*
        - If HIV+ and not on ART, plus allergy to Measles combines them: *“Postpone the measles vaccination until stabilized with ART treatment if the child is HIV+ and showing symptoms of severe immunosuppression. Note it is contraindicated to give the measles vaccine if the child has had a previous severe allergic reaction to the vaccine.”*
    - Rotavirus (RV) has 3 possible warnings that could be triggered based on the pre-immunization questions: HIV+, allergy, and current high temperature
        - If HIV+ and/or allergy is selected this warning will appear: *“It is contraindicated to give the Rotavirus vaccine if the child is HIV+ and not on ART and/or severely immuno-compromised, or if there was a previous severe allergic reaction”.*
        - If all 3 contraindications present (HIV+, allergy, and current high temperature) are selected for Rotavirus, the HIV+ and allergy warning supersedes the temperature warning.
        - The high temperature warning only displays if there is a high temperature, but the more restrictive contraindications are not entered. This warning will appear: *"Be aware, it is advisable to defer vaccination until after an acute infection and/or with temperature >39 degree C”*

    Example of combined warnings that appear based on the selected options for the pre-immunization questions:
