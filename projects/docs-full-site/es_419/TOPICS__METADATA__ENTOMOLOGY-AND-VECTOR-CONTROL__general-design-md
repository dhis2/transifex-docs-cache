# Entomology & Vector Control - System Design Guide { #ento-vc-design }

## Antecedentes y objetivos { #background-and-purpose } 

The DHIS2 standard modules for **Entomology and Vector Control (E&VC)** have been developed to support countries to improve the collection and use of entomological and vector control interventions data  to inform programmatic decisions.
All the modules have been designed in line with existing WHO recommendations, standard protocols and guidance. These modules complement already existing modules for [malaria epidemiology](https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/index.html#malaria). They contain a set of standard data collection forms, automatically calculated indicators, data visualizations and thematic dashboards that allow to collect, visualize and interpret data from the following activities in line with WHO recommendations:

- [ITN Bioefficacy Monitoring](#ento-itn-bsm-design)
- [IRS Residual Efficacy Monitoring](#ento-irs-rem-design)
- [Larviciding](#ento-itn-bio-design)
- [IRS Mass Campaign](#vc-irs-campaign)
- [ITN Mass Campaign](#vc-itn-mc-design)

The WHO configuration packages consist of DHIS2 metadata that provide standard configurations of DHIS2 to support the collection of health data following WHO recommendations.

## System Design Overview { #system-design-overview } 

### Caso de uso { #use-case } 

With these modules, countries can:

- **collect data** from the field, insectaries or laboratories, using mobile phones, tablets or computers, online and offline, and geolocated;
- **integrate entomological and vector control data** with epidemiological data and other types of relevant data (e.g. climatological data, stock data);
- **calculate standard** entomological and vector control indicators automatically and
- **develop custom visualizations** (tables, graphs and maps) and dashboard to inform specific needs.

### General Structure of the Activities { #general-structure-of-the-activities } 

This chapter summarizes the published modules as of August 2023. It will be updated as more modules and packages are added to their respective E&VC activities.

The diagram provides an overview (from darker to lighter green) of the **activities, modules, and packages** currently available in the DHIS2 for E&VC. Further use cases and descriptions will be provided in the design guides of the modules.

### Rationale for Program Structure { #rationale-for-program-structure } 

Every standard method or procedure for the collection of entomological data and every vector control intervention is different and requires a different data collection process. For this reason, several modules have been developed, each to support a different entomological or vector control activity.  Such a modular approach allows countries to choose which modules to implement, depending on their national needs.

Entomological data is often collected through bioassays or mosquito collections that are repeated several times for the same place and time period (e.g multiple WHO cone bioassay for the monitoring of IRS efficacy can be conducted on the same day in different houses, several traps can be placed on the same night in different houses of a village to collect mosquitoes), in addition, some vector control activities also require collecting data repeatedly for the same geographical and time period (e.g. indoor residual spraying in several houses in one area on the same day). Therefore, the entomology and vector control modules make use of both event and tracker programs to meet the needs of entomologist and vector control specialists in the field.

During implementation in countries, modules are adopted to country needs to facilitate their field data collection.

### Intended Users { #intended-users } 

These packages are intended to be used by:

- **Field entomologists** and personnel involved in the implementation of vector control interventions to collect data on entomology and vector control activities
- **Laboratory technicians** to enter results on mosquito analysis
- Vector-borne disease **program managers and public health officers** to interpret the data collected and use such information during decision making processes.

## User Groups { #user-groups } 

| User group        | Tablero (Dashboard)         | Program Metadata  | Program data         |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **ENTO-Admin**        | Puede editar y visualizar | Puede editar y visualizar | No Access            |
| **ENTO-Access**       | Puede editar y visualizar | Solo lectura     | Solo lectura        |
| **ENTO-Data capture** | No access         | Solo lectura     | Puede capturar y visualizar |

## Android Compatibility { #android-compatibility } 

DHIS2 configuration packages are also compaitble with the DHIS2 Android Capture App, free to download on the GooglePlay store. Key considerations in design was to ensure that all forms are configured with sections that structure form layout for better display on the android devices. Also, with the requirement of minimal data disaggregation in this package, all the dataSet layout should provide a concise view for Android display.

## Data Triangulation - Entomology and Malaria { #data-triangulation-entomology-and-malaria } 

The data collected in the entomology and vector control programs can be triangulated with the malar[malaria surveillance tracker for the follow up of foci](#mal-cs-design). In addition, the data from entomology and vector control programs can be jointly analyzed with the epidemiological data collected through the malaria surveillance tracker for the follow up of foci, the health-facility malaria aggregate package or the CHIS package for malaria to gain a better understanding of disease transmission dynamics,  to identify priority areas for vector control interventions, to understand the effectiveness of vector control interventions and to investigate outbreaks or unexpected changes in disease burden. The entomological and vector control packages should be use jointly for better results. For example, data from the [IRS](#ento-irs-rem-design) implementation packages should be interpreted together with data from them IRS residual efficacy package to understand the potential effectiveness of this intervention, as well as to plan future IRS campaigns. Data from the discriminating concentration bioassay packages should be interpreted together with data from the intensity concentration package, the synergist insecticide bioassay package and the mosquito from bioassay package to gain a comprehensive understand of vector resistance to insecticides in an area.

Other examples of possible data triangulations are the triangulation with numbers used to analyze in more depth either facility-based data like the information reported via the [malaria aggregate](#mal-agg-design) packages, or community-based data via the [CHIS package](#chis-agg-design) for [malaria](#chis-mal-agg-design), [integrated community case management](#chis-iccm-agg-design) or [community-based surveillance](#chis-cbs-agg-design).

## Further resources { #further-resources } 

DHIS2, in collaboration with the WHO, organized a [webinar](https://youtu.be/9NwZPWGkNsU) to explain and outline the use cases for the use of the "Breeding sites", "ITN - Bioefficacy" and "IRS - Residual efficacy" packages. The webinal also provides insights on the use of the malarial foci vs entomology modules.
