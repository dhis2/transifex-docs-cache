selecting "Create" from the contextual menu. If there are any
pre-defined parameters, you will see a report parameter window where you
must fill in the values needed for orgunit and/or reporting month,
depending on what has been defined in the underlying report table(s).
Click on "Generate Report" when you are ready. The report will either appear
directly in your browser or be available as a PDF file for download,
depending on your browser settings for handling PDF files. You can save
the file and keep it locally on your computer for later use.

## Using dataset reports { #dataset_reports_in_the_beta_reports_app } 

Dataset reports are printer friendly views of the data entry screen
filled with either raw or aggregated data.

Puede acceder a los reportes de set de datos desde Aplicaciones-\>Informes.

A Criteria window will appear where you fill in the details for your
report:

**Set de datos:** El set de datos que desea mostrar.

**Report period:** The actual period you want data for. This can be
aggregated as well as raw periods. This means that you can ask for a
quarterly or annual report even though the data set is collected
monthly. A data set's period type (collection frequency) is defined in
data set maintenance. First select the period type (Monthly, Quarterly,
Yearly etc.) in the drop down next to Prev and Next buttons, and then
select one of the available periods from the dropdown list below. Use
Prev and Next to jump one year back or forward.

**Use data for selected unit only:** Use this option if you want a
report for an orgunit that has children, but only want the data
collected directly for this unit and not the data collected by its
children. If you want a typical aggregated report for an orgunit you do
not want to tick this option.

**Report Organisation unit:** Here you select the orgunit you want
the report for. This can be at any level in the hierarchy as the data
will be aggregated up to this level automatically (if you do not tick
the option above).

When you are done filling in the report criteria you click on
"Generate". The report will appear as HTML in a printer-friendly format.
Use the print and save as functions in the browser to print or save (as
HTML) the report.You can also export the data set report in Excel and
PDF formats.

## Using reporting rate summary { #reporting_rate_summary_in_the_beta_reports_app } 

Access the reporting rate summary from the Apps-\>Reports menu.
Reporting rate summaries will show how many datasets (forms) that have
been submitted by organisation unit and period.

The reporting rate is calculation is based on complete data set registrations.
A complete data set registration refers to a user marking a data entry form as
complete, typically by clicking the complete button in the data entry screen,
hereby indicating to the system that she considers the form to be
complete. This is i.e. a subjective approach to calculating
completeness.

El resumen de tasas de notificación mostrará para cada fila un rango de medida:

  - Actual reports: Indicates the number of data entry complete
    registrations for the relevant data set.

  - Expected reports: Indicates how many data entry complete
    registrations are expected. This number is based on the number of
    organisation units the relevant data set has been assigned to
    (enabled for data entry).

  - Reporting rate: The percentage of reports registered as complete based on
    the number expected.

  - Reports on time: Same as actual reports, only reports registered as
    complete within the maximum number of days after the end of the
    reporting period. This number of days after reporting period can be
    defined per data set in the data set management.

  - Reporting rate on time: Same as percentage, only reports registered as
    complete on time used as numerator.

Para ejecutar el informe, puede seguir estos pasos:

  - Seleccionar una unidad organizativa del árbol.

  - Seleccionar un set de datos.

  - Select a period type and a period from the list of available periods
    for that period type.

  - The report will then be rendered. Change any of the parameters above
    and click "Get report" again see the corresponding results.
