# CH - Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) { #ch-ntd-aggregate-design }

## 1.Datasets { #1datasets }

### 1.1. Configuration summary { #11-configuration-summary }

The aggregate CH - Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for NTDs
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on adolescent health
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - NTDs” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements { #12-data-elements }

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the NTDs module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the NTDs module are used in the build up of indicators.
