# Release Note { #cvc-eir-release-note }

## 1.2.0 { #120 } 

A new version of the COVID-19 Vaccine EIR package has been released with configuration fixes and improvements. A detailed changelog of all metadata changes is included in [insert package repository link from GH].  

### New Features { #new-features } 

New **tracker data elements** were added to conform to the WHO's [Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates: Vaccination Status (2021)](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Digital_certificates-vaccination-data_dictionary-2021.1) core data dictionary:

* Created DE “Vaccine Brand”
* Created DE “Health Worker Identifier”

New **dashboard** [COVAC - Daily Monitoring, `YYtAbckt77l`] added to optimize performance for real-time vaccine delivery monitoring. The new dashboard is mapped to aggregate domain indicators and data elements for aggregating tracker data.

New **aggregate dataset** [COVAC - EIR aggregated tracker data, `tM6PFnTKKGP`] and **aggregate data elements** for storing program indicator values for aggregated tracker data. The new dataset and data elements are intended to feed the Daily Monitoring Dashboard.

**Program indicators** were modified to include a mapping (based on program indicator attributes) to target aggregate domain data elements and category option combinations to populate the aggregate dataset & dashboard.

### Improvements { #improvements } 

Removed previous **dashboard** [COVID-19 Vaccine Registry, `YYtAbckt77l`] and associated analytics objects to prevent performance issues associated with users loading dashboards based on Program Indicators that calculate on the fly with heavy queries.

**Tracked entity attributes** configured to be uniquely generated by system were modified to improve tracker performance at large-scale. The use of RANDOM pattern generation for unique system id was discarded in favor of a more performant SEQUENTIAL pattern.

* Removed TEA ['Unique system identifier (EPI), `KSr2yTdu1AI`], with pattern "EPI" + RANDOM(########)
* Created TEA ['Unique system identifier (Vaccination), `iJ2HySGRDTh`] using pattern "EPI" + SEQUENTIAL(########)

**Program indicator** expression for [Number of people receiving a second, third or booster dose] and all disaggregations of this program indicator were modified with an added parentheses as follows to allow for a more accurate count of second dose patients.

```
(#{a1jCssI2LkW.LUIsbsm3okG} == 'DOSE2' || #{a1jCssI2LkW.LUIsbsm3okG} == 'DOSE3' || #{a1jCssI2LkW.LUIsbsm3okG} == 'BOOSTER') && **(**#{a1jCssI2LkW.bbnyNYD1wgS} == 'ASTRAZENECA' || #{a1jCssI2LkW.bbnyNYD1wgS} == 'BIONTECHPFIZER' || #{a1jCssI2LkW.bbnyNYD1wgS} == 'MODERNA' || #{a1jCssI2LkW.bbnyNYD1wgS} == 'GAMALEYA' || #{a1jCssI2LkW.bbnyNYD1wgS} == 'SINOPHARM'**)** && V{program_stage_id} == 'a1jCssI2LkW'
```

**Program rules** were modified to improve the tracker workflow:

| Regla de programa                                                 | Change                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Last dose - complete program & hide "Date for next dose"     | Changed the Priority to “20” so that the PR is solved after the PR which assigns the last dose check </br> Removed prompt to complete the program |
| If this is the second dose, mark it as "last dose" for all vaccine products | Change priority to 10 so that the PR is solved before the PR which hides the next dose date </br> Program rule action modified so that the value is also assigned to the variable “Last_dose” |
| Assign a suggested date for next dose XXXX (replace XXXX for vaccine product) | Priority changed to “30” so that PR is solved after the previous two PRs |
| Assign name to XXXX                                          | Modified to 'Assign Brand and manufacturer to XXX' </br> Program Rule Action modified to assign the manufacturer and brand based on the vaccine name instead of the other way around. |
| Assign name/Hide options to AstraZeneca/ astrazeneca         | Name modified to 'Assign Brand/Hide manufacturer options to AstraZeneca/ astrazeneca' |

**Code fields** for metadata objects were modified to conform with updated configuration standards for DHIS2 metadata packages. For example, many codes have been updated to use capital letters (Astrazeneca=ASTRAZENECA, Yes=YES, etc).

## 1.1.0 { #110 } 

1. Modified program rule “  If previous vaccine is same as current vaccine, hide explanation field”
2. Added program rule “Hide Suggested date for next dose if second dose and vaccine product has no more doses”
3. Modified expression in Program rule “If patient has had underlying diseases, transfer that value to following stage” and added action to assign value to current PR variable.
4. Modified expressions in Program rules “If client has a history of XXX assign value to current event”

## 0.5.0 { #050 } 

1. Changed COVAX to COVAC
2. Changed order of Custom working lists
3. Added a prefix “COVAC” to objects which could give import issues with instances that have existing packages (Sex, Yes/No/Unknown/, Urban/Rural)

8. Changed AEFI notification from “Please ensure to register this adverse effect in the AEFI stage” to “Please conduct an AEFI investigation following the official procedures for AEFI investigations”
9. Changed placeholder codes
