# Release Note { #imm-agg-release-note }

## 1.0.0 { #100 } 

A new version (1.0.0) of the immunization package has been released with new visualizations and improvements. These are summarized below.

### New Content { #new-content } 

#### Immunization Analysis app visualizations { #immunization-analysis-app-visualizations } 

Due to the continuous improvement process of the DHIS2 core platform and applications, several visualizations previously done with the [Immunization Analysis app](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/metadata/immunization/immunization-analysis-app/app-version-103/user-manual.html) are now possible to be reproduced with the core “Data visualizer” app.
Several visualizations have been included in the “Immunization” global dashboard:

- EPI - Doses and coverage by antigens - months this year
- Monitoring chart for antigens administered <1 years old child - Months this year
- Monitoring chart for antigens administered in newborns - Months this year
- Coverage and dropout rate categorization - last 12 months
- Categorization of immunization performance by district - last 12 months

#### Indicators and legend { #indicators-and-legend } 

The visualizations from the “Immunization Analysis app” include legends and interpretations to support the analysis and interpretation of the results.

### Fixes & improvements { #fixes-improvements } 

#### Dashboard remodelling { #dashboard-remodelling } 

All the visualizations previously present on the “Immunization maps” dashboard have been included on the “Immunization” general dashboard. The “Immunization maps” dashboard has therefore been removed.
