# TB Household Contacts - System Design Document { #tb-agg-hh-design }

## Background and Purpose { #background-and-purpose }

The **TB Household Contacts (TB HH)** digital data package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing the data originating from the planned/undertaken TB programs activities.The TB HH aggregate metadata package has therefore been designed as an installable solution for countries to update their DHIS2-based HMIS according to the updated version of the [“WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 1: prevention: tuberculosis preventive treatment”](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240001503).

This TB HH Aggregate System Design document provides an overview of the design principles and global technical guidance used to develop a WHO standard metadata package for monitoring the preventive activities for household contacts of TB index cases. This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and local level to be able to support implementation and localisation of the package. The TB HH metadata package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines.

This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localization of the configuration package while adhering to the design principles set forth.

## System Design Overview { #system-design-overview }

### Use Case { #use-case }

The TB HH module follows the logic behind TB preventive activities among household contacts:

![Data flow](resources/images/tb_hh_000_en.png)

It is recommended that the TB HH module gets assigned to Organisation Units at the **lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data.

Digital data packages are optimized for Android data collection with the DHIS2 Capture App, free to download on the [GooglePlay store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhis2&hl=en).

### Program Structure { #program-structure }

The structure of the TB HH module is very simple:

-   **One quarterly aggregated dataset (TB Household Contacts)** for the identification and follow up of HH contacts who are eligible and have started TPT. The package captures a minimum number of data points that meet the current WHO reporting requirements. The data are collected quarterly to allow for the correct follow-up timeframe of the TPT course.

-   **One predefined dashboard (TB7. HH Contacts)**.The analytics and dashboards included in the package are designed to support the routine analysis (with particular focus on HIV+ contacts and contacts under the age of 5 years), and use of TPT data at national and sub-national levels.

### Intended Users { #intended-users }

The intended users of this package are:

-   **Clinical and program management users** at local level for data entry and monitoring of the identification and adherence activities.

-   **Program managers** at district and national levels for the monitoring and performance evaluation of the program.

## Dataset Configuration { #dataset-configuration }

The table below lists the data elements configured in the TB HH dataset.

> **Note**
>
> **ALL** the data elements are used to build indicators **ALL** data elements are linked to validation rules The **zero value** has been set as **significant** They are organized in the **TB-HH data element group**

| UID | Nombre | Descripción |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fbAdmzvjLuY` | TB-HH - Notified ICs | Number of index TB cases registered and notified |
| `UIHbSe2XmPa` | TB-HH - Contacts identified | Number of contacts who have been identified |
| `CyOAgl64a0b` | TB-HH - Contacts screened | Number of contacts who have been screened |
| `nyzwxN9M9t7` | TB-HH - Contacts eligible for TPT | Number of contacts eligible to start TPT in the last year |

## Datasets Details { #datasets-details }

### TB Index Cases { #tb-index-cases }

![Index cases](resources/images/tb_hh_001_en.png)

The section reports the number of index cases who have been notified in the quarter under analysis.

### Household Contacts of Index TB Cases { #household-contacts-of-index-tb-cases }

![HH contacts](resources/images/tb_hh_002_en.png)

The section reports the ICs’ HH contacts who have been identified and screened.

### TB Preventive Treatment { #tb-preventive-treatment }

![TPT eligibility and initiation](resources/images/tb_hh_003_en.png)

The section provides the necessary information on TT eligibility and initiation.

### TB Preventive Treatment Outcomes { #tb-preventive-treatment-outcomes }

![TPT outcomes](resources/images/tb_hh_004_en.png)

The section reports the information on contacts’ adherence to the TPT.

## Validation Rules { #validation-rules }

**None of the VRs are set to block the data entry**. Should any of the numbers not match the logic behind the rules, the description of the broken rule will simply highlight the gap and will nonetheless let the system save the data. The following validation rules have been created in order to ensure the logic and the quality of the collected data:

> **Note**
>
> The “TB-HH - Notified ICs vs Identified contacts” rule: In the VERY rare case that it is a low burden rural health facility, should we make an exception if there is 1 index case, with 0 household contacts. In this case the implementer should consider whether the rule would not be logical for the local context.

## Analytics and Indicators { #analytics-and-indicators }

The following indicators have been predefined for the monitoring of the activities. The indicators are organized in the TB - HH Indicators group. The numerators and denominators are using the abbreviations commonly used in TB programs. Nonetheless, in [Annex 1](#tb-nomenclature-translation), there is a table with the “translation” of the nomenclature in order to avoid any confusion.

## Dashboards { #dashboards }

The TB HH module includes a predefined dashboard called **TB7. TB HH Contacts.**

The dashboard is numbered as number 7 to fit in the bigger picture of the aggregate TB activities. Dashboards numbers 1 to 6 are linked to the datasets described in the [TB Aggregate System Design Document](#tb-aggregate-design).

![TB HH dashboard](resources/images/tb_hh_005_en.png)

The predefined dashboard contains the following items:

| TB-HH-009 | TBc_7.3c_TPT eligibility vs initiation among PLHIV | TB-HH - Contacts eligible for TPT among PLHIV <br> TB-HH - TB preventive treatment initiation among PLHIV (%) | Lines, double axes |

## Data Triangulation { #data-triangulation }

In order to ensure consistency across programs and data, the TB-HH - TB index cases identified indicator can be checked against the TB - Notified TB cases (all cases, all forms) indicator belonging to the TB case notification dataset based on the [“Definitions and reporting framework for tuberculosis – 2013 revision”](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/79199/9789241505345_eng.pdf;jsessionid=0911B3678B5EF8EBD24C834EA882F199?sequence=1) document. The dataset is part of the [TB Aggregate System Design](#tb-aggregate-design).

This of course can only be done if other datasets belonging to the TB general package are downloaded and used in the same instance.

## Android Compatibility { #android-compatibility }

Digital data packages are optimized for Android data collection with the DHIS2 Capture App, free to download on the [GooglePlay store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhis2&hl=en). Key considerations in design was to ensure that all forms are configured with sections that structure form layout for better display on the android devices. Also, with the requirement of minimal data disaggregation in this package, all the dataSet layout should provide a concise view for Android display.
