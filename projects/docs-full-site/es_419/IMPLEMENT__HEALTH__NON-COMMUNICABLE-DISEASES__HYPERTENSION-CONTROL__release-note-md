# Release Note { #ncd-htn-release_note }

## 1.0.0 { #100 } 

The DHIS2 Hypertension Control Package supports management of hypertension control programs at the primary care level. Since high blood pressure affects a high proportion of the population, this tracker is designed as a limited dataset on routine hypertension care to improve facility-level analysis, while still minimizing reporting burden on care providers. The configuration is appropriate for national-scale hypertension management programs with high patient-load clinical environments, and is tailored for seamless use with the Android Capture app.
