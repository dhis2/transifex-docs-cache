# HIV Case Surveillance Metadata Package System Design { #hiv_cs_design }

## Background and Purpose { #background-and-purpose }

The HIV Case Surveillance system is designed to support implementation of the [WHO’s consolidated guidelines on person-centered HIV patient monitoring and case surveillance (2017)](http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/person-centred-hiv-monitoring-guidelines/en/) and the updated 2020 [Consolidated HIV Strategic Information Guidelines: Driving Impact Through Programme Monitoring and Managemen](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/331697)t, as well as the not yet published Digital Accelerator Kit for HIV.

HIV Case Surveillance is related to, yet distinct from, patient monitoring; it refers to the “reporting of an initial diagnosis of HIV infection and defined sentinel events from every person diagnosed with HIV to a public health agency responsible for monitoring and controlling the epidemic. Key sentinel events include HIV diagnosis, entry into care, initiation of ART, viral suppression and death. Information from each case is linked over time and stored as individual-level data in a database at subnational and/or national levels. HIV case surveillance is referred to in some countries as case notification or case reporting, particularly when limited to reporting of new HIV diagnoses without longitudinal data capture. The ability to link notifications or reports of sentinel events to a case over time and maintain data in disaggregated form at the individual level are the distinguishing features of HIV case surveillance systems.”

The basic principles of operation are based on the [WHO’s Consolidated Guidelines on Person-Centred HIV Surveillance](https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/person-centred-hiv-monitoring-guidelines/en/) and respective annexes, whilst at the same time being informed by the yet to be published[Digital Accelerator Kit for HIV.](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/digital-accelerator-kits/en/)

## System Design Overview { #system-design-overview }

### Use Case { #use-case }

The requirements for tracking an individual case over time and linking key sentinel events to that case necessitates the use of unique identification standards, possibly composed of one or more unique identifiers, and/or patient identifying information. The Tracker data model in DHIS2 is used to meet these requirements. This program is designed to capture the minimum data elements necessary to produce the required indicators identified by[the consolidated guidelines for person-centered HIV monitoring](https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/person-centred-hiv-monitoring-guidelines/en/). \
The program includes some basic level of decision support and prompts to aid those countries which will be using it within a clinical setting, thereby adding the need for extra data inputs. Whilst the primary purpose of this configuration is for programme management, it can be modified to be used as a clinical care tool.

### Flujo de trabajo { #workflow }

![Workflow](resources/images/workflow.png)

### Programme Structure { #programme-structure }

| Stage | Descripción |
| --- | --- |
| Inscripción | Once a patient is identified as HIV positive they should be enrolled in the HIV Case Surveillance Programme. The enrollment stage includes personal information and unique identifiers, some of which will be auto generated. All patients enrolled in this registry are HIV positive, and therefore it is important that access is limited to those who need it, this requires adapting to local patient privacy policies and local needs.Identifying information (Patient profile) is available as a widget in the tracker capture data entry screen. |
| Initial Case Report | The initial case report can be filled at the same time as the enrollment of the patient.This stage contains the baseline for the rest of the treatment, including date of HIV diagnosis and age at diagnosis. If the patient belongs to a key population group, it can be selected here. This is a non-repeatable stage as the initiation details are only collected once for each case that is registered. |
| Treatment Visit | The Visit stage is the stage where all the treatment components are recorded.Once the reason for the visit is recorded, the first check is the reason for the visit and whether or not the PLHIV has begun their treatment and when. The rest of the data elements are hidden until the treatment has started.The second check is whether the PLHIV is eligible for Tuberculosis preventive therapy. If they are, a section on TPT is unhidden, where the treatment start, type and completion can be recorded. Finally there is a treatment status check, where PLHIV can be categorised as Retained on ART, having stopped their treatment, transferred or died.If the treatment status is retained on ART, it reveals the option to add how many days of ART is provided and it automatically calculates when is their last day with ART.If the patient has been on ART for more than 180 days, the fields for viral load testing information appear, including the test date, viral load status and if available, the previous viral load value. This is a repeatable stage, as it will be conducted continuously over the lifespan of the case re-visiting the clinic to pick up medicine, perform checkups,and routine (and/or targeted) viral load testing, based on WHO and national clinical guidelines. |
| Follow-Up | This Stage is not tied to any indicators and is purely designed as a tool for recording any contact made with patients who have missed treatment visits, and will need to be contacted. This is a repeatable stage, to allow for multiple follow-ups. |

## Tracker Configuration { #tracker-configuration }

### Tracked Entity Instance { #tracked-entity-instance }

The program uses the Tracked Entity Instance type “Person”. The TEI will be enrolled for their lifetime in this tracker and they will be enrolled after they have been diagnosed with HIV. This presumes that there is a separate registry for HIV tests outside of this program.

### Stages { #stages }

#### Enrollment & Initial Case Stages { #enrollment-initial-case-stages }

The initial case stage is included with the enrollment stage to facilitate data entry. Note that sections and some of the program rule actions are not supported when the stage is included in the enrollment screen, and therefore some of the form behaviour might not be as expected.

![Enrollment](resources/images/enrollment.png)

##### Enrollment { #enrollment }

The enrollment stage gathers all the attributes of a person registered. A country should modify the enrollment to ensure that it matches their needs and practices.

| Attribute name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Enrolling organisation unit | Unidad Organizativa |
| Enrollment date | Fecha |
| Given Name | texto |
| Family Name | texto |
| Date of Birth is Estimated | yes only |
| Date of Birth | date |
| Gender | OptionSet: Male/Female/Transgender/Other |
| Address (current) | texto |
| Mobile phone number | phone number |
| Country of Birth | Country list |
| National ID | number/text |
| Health Facility Code | texto |
| Program ID | System Generated |
| NHIS ID | System Generated |
| Communication consent - the client gives consent to be contacted | Yes/No |

###### Identifiers { #identifiers }

Currently, the programme has four unique identifiers in addition to personally identifying information in order to minimise duplication. If the identifiers are all done within the same instance of DHIS2, they can all be validated as unique. Modifying the identifiers is likely to be one of the first changes needed to adapt the package to the local context.

National ID : A unique identifier usually provided by a national CRVS office.

Health facility code: A local patient identifier which may be derived from existing paper records.

Program ID: A Unique identifier within the HIV programme. This is sometimes referred to as the ART number or Patient number. If it does not exist on enrollment, it can later be added.

NHIS ID: An identifier for the patient within the NHIS and independent of the case surveillance programme.

DHIS2 can be programmed to assign unique identifiers automatically based on a rule-set and general expression, or allow for manual input of unique and non-unique identifiers depending on country needs and capabilities.

If you will be using android devices, there are some issues if the system-assigned pattern is sequential or date-based. More information here: [https://docs.dhis2.org/](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/android-implementation/dhis2-configuration-for-android.html#implementation_guide_dhis2_config_reserved_id)

##### Initial Case { #initial-case }

The initial case stage is annexed to the enrollment stage for data entering purposes. This stage records the basic information about the patient's HIV diagnosis that is not likely to change. (If there is a change to KP status, for example the patient is no longer incarcerated, this can later be updated in the case report if necessary).

| Nombre | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Informe de caso inicial | date |
| Date of HIV positive test | date |
| Type of community-level testing | Option set: Type of community-level testing: Mobile testing (e.g. through vans or temporary testing facilities); Voluntary Counselling and Testing centres (not within a health facility setting); Other community based testing |
| Entry point for facility level testing | Option SetEntry point for facility-level testing: Mobile testing (e.g. through vans or temporary testing facilities); Voluntary Counselling and Testing centres (not within a health facility setting); Other community based testing |
| Age when diagnosed with HIV | Calculated age (Integer) |
| Is this infant a case of vertical transmission? | Yes/no, Only visible if case is under 2 years old. |
| Does this person belong to any Key Population groups, such as: Men who have sex with men. Injection drug users. People in prison or other closed settings. Sex workers. | Yes/No |
| Key population - Men who have sex with men | Sólo Sí |
| Key population - Injection drug users | Sólo Sí |
| Key population - people in prison or other closed settings | Sólo Sí |
| Key population - Sex worker | Sólo Sí |
| Key population - Transgender | Sólo Sí |

![Initial case report](resources/images/initial.png)

If a patient’s gender is marked as “transgender”, a warning shows up prompting the user to mark their key population status as “transgender”.

#### Treatment Visit { #treatment-visit }

![Visit](resources/images/visit.png)

| Nombre | Value | Comment/Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visit Date | Fecha | Event date feature |
| Due date | Fecha | Due date for event |
| Reason for visit | Option set "Reason for visit": Clinical Visit; Antiretroviral drug pick-up; Issues and concerns |  |
| Treatment started | Yes/No | Hides treatment section when "Yes" is not selected, value "Yes" is transferred to new events. |
| Date of treatment initiation | Fecha | This is a date element used to calculate when the initiation takes place. Once entered the first time, the date value entered will transfer to future visits |
| The patient is eligible for TB Preventive treatment | Sólo Sí | If this is not checked, TPT elements are hidden |
| Date deemed eligible for TB preventive treatment | Fecha | Fill only once, perdures through subsequent visits |
| TB preventive treatment initiated | Fecha | Fill only once, perdures through subsequent visits |
| TB preventive treatment regimen | Option Set: TBT Regimen | Fill only once, perdures through subsequent visits; See yellow tab "Option Sets" |
| TB preventive treatment date completed | Fecha | Fill only once, perdures through subsequent visits |
| Restart TB preventive treatment | Sólo Sí | Once checked, it makes the other fields editable. Appears only after the TB preventive treatment is completed. |
| Treatment Status | Option Set: patient Status | If status is not "retained on ART" the rest of the stage is hidden |
| Currently pregnant | Sólo Sí | Appears only if client is "on treatment" and is a woman. |
| Date of Death | date | Appears only if option "Death" is selected |
| Date client status changed | date | Appears only if options "Reused treatment", "Transferred out" or "Lost to follow up" are selected |
| HIV viral load test date | date | Only visible if days between treatment start and event >180 |
| Viral Load <1000 | checkmark (Yes only) | Only visible if days between treatment start and event >180 |
| HIV viral load test result | Número | Only visible if days between treatment start and event >180, and if "Viral load <1000" is not checked |
| Previous Viral load value | Número | Only visible if days between treatment start and event >180. Displays the viral load value from the previous visit automatically, if there was a previous visit. |
| Days of ART provided | Número |  |
| Last date with ART | Displays the last date where the patient has medicine | Automatically calculated based on "Visit date" + "Days of ART provided" |

The Treatment visit stage is divided into three sections.

Clinical Surveillance:

The clinical surveillance section starts by asking whether or not the PLHIV has started antiretroviral treatment (ART). If the patient has started their treatment, the treatment section appears. Likewise, if the “the patient is eligible for TB preventive therapy” field is marked, this section appears. Otherwise, both sections will remain hidden. If the treatment is initiated after 14 days, a late initiation message will appear in the top bar.

TPT: The TPT section records the date when the person was deemed eligible for TB preventive treatment (based on initial and/or follow-up TB symptom screening), the date when it was initiated and regimen, and the date of completion. Once values are entered here, they will perdure in following stages and no additional data entry is needed.

Once a patient has completed their treatment, the field “Restart TPT” will show up. Checking this box will allow you to delete the existing values and start a new round of TPT.

![TB preventive therapy](resources/images/tpt.png)

Treatment:

The first Data Element in the treatment section asks to select the status of the treatment. If a patient is marked as “Retained on ART” the rest of the fields appear. If a patient is marked as dead, stopped treatment, officially transferred out, or lost to follow up, the rest of the fields remain hidden.

If the patient has been in ART for less than 180 days (6 months), a message reads “Viral load fields are only available to patients who have been on ART for six months or more.” Once a patient has been on ART for 180 days or more (From treatment start date to current date), the fields to register viral load testing and status appear.

![Viral load testing](resources/images/viral_load.png)

The viral load fields include a checkbox for when the PLHIV enters viral suppression: less than 1000 copies/ml, which is based on the current WHO guidelines, but this should be adapted according to national clinical guidelines.

If if the viral load is less than 1000 copies/ml, the field “Viral load test results (entered as a number)” is hidden and the top bar displays the legend “this person is virally suppressed”

At the end of the section inputting the days of ART provided will calculate the last date with ART, which is an aid to schedule the next appointment.

### Follow Up { #follow-up }

![Follow up](resources/images/followup.png)

| Nombre | Value | Comentario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Date of attempt to contact client | date | Feature |
| Reason for follow up | Reason for follow up: Missed clinical care visit Missed medication pickup Missed non-clinical care visit Did not initiate ART Inconclusive HIV status Test results received Other follow up reason (specify) |  |
| HIV Follow-up Method | Option set Follow up Methods: Text Message Phone Home visit Other |  |
| HIV Follow-up Outcome | Option set Follow up outcomes: Returning to clinic Self transferred out Hospitalized Refused to return Not located Died (reported) Confirmed dead | If one selects Died (reported); Died (confirmed), Not located, or Refused to return, then warning appears: "If a patient changed status (died, moved, decided to stop treatment, has been out of treatment for more than 28 days, etc.) you must complete a visit stage and record this change in status." |
| HIV Follow-up Notes | Long Text |  |

The follow up stage is designed to be useful when a patient has not attended their latest appointment, but is still under treatment. It is not currently linked to indicators and can safely be removed from the programme if not used in a clinical setting without affecting the other modules.

It records the reason why this follow up is needed (Missed clinical care visit, missed medication pickup, missed non-clinical visit, did not initiate ART, inconclusive HIV status, test results received, Other follow up reason) follow-up method (Text message, phone call, home visit or other) and the result of the follow up (Returning to clinic, self-transferred out, hospitalized, refused to return, not located, reported dead, confirmed dead). If when following-up the patient has changed their treatment status (for example, decided to stop treatment), the program displays a prompt to complete a Visit stage option and record this.

![Follow up](resources/images/followup2.png)

### Data Entry Screen Set-up { #data-entry-screen-set-up }

An initial setup is necessary to optimally configure the patient data entry screen.

By clicking on the cog icon on the top right hand side you can access the widget menu and organise the data entry dashboard to match local workflows by hiding or showing widgets.

![Widgets menu](resources/images/widgets.png)

We recommend that the programme is used with “tabular data entry” instead of “Timeline data entry”, and that it includes at least the enrollment, feedback, indicators, profile and report widgets, as well as the top bar. System administrators can lock the layout for all other users.

![Top Bar](resources/images/topbar.png)

The top information bar can be used to highlight relevant information. In this picture, it shows the name, date of birth, the number of days since the last visit (in case it has exceeded 28 days) and the number of days without medicine if relevant. This bar can be modified and configured according to the user's need to display other information. For information on how to configure the top bar see the documentation: [https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-236/tracking-individual-level-data/tracker-capture.html#top-bar](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-236/tracking-individual-level-data/tracker-capture.html#top-bar)

### Security and Access { #security-and-access }

For general security considerations about your DHIS2 instance, please see [https://dhis2.org/security/](https://dhis2.org/security/)

#### Search Settings { #search-settings }

The programme is currently set to “Open” which means that, as long as users are allowed to search in other org units by the [user search settings](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/understanding-dhis2-implementation/users-and-user-roles.html) which have been assigned to the them, they will be able to search and access patients in other organisation units.

A more secure option would be to set up the programme as **protected**. This means that a user may read and write to tracked entity instances that are owned by the organisation unit(s) to which the user is assigned data capture access, but their search scope should be wider than their read/write scope in order to ensure that they will identify any existing patients during a search, even if they do not belong to their facility. If the search returns a patient that exists outside of their facility, the user is presented with the option to access the patient record by first recording a reason for accessing the record. This approach to privacy is known as ‘breaking the glass’, as it allows the user to make the decision to access the record without outside permission or assistance, but leaves a clear trail to be audited. Once the user gives a reason for breaking the glass, they gain temporary ownership of the tracked entity instance (see the [Tracker User Guide](https://docs.dhis2.org/2.34/en/dhis2_user_manual_en/using-the-tracker-capture-app.html#breaking-the-glass) for more information.)

Note that for android-based implementations, if you want users to be able to search clients in a different org unit than their own, the search settings MUST be set to “open” as the other search features are not fully supported. More information available here: [https://docs.dhis2.org/en/full/implement/dhis2-android-configuration-guide.html](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/full/implement/dhis2-android-configuration-guide.html)

#### User Management { #user-management }

There are three user groups currently included in the package.

**HIV Case Surveillance - Data Analysis**: Has access to dashboards but cannot modify metadata or enter new data

**HIV - Case Surveillance - Data Entry**: Can enter data and create new patient records

**HIV Case Surveillance - Metadata Admin**: Can modify the metadata

The country implementing it should ensure that users have data entry rights for their respective Organisation units, and search rights for all organisation units which will be providing HIV services to facilitate movement between clinics.

#### Referrals and Ownership { #referrals-and-ownership }

Within Tracker, the organisational unit is both the enrolling org unit and has ownership of the case. The ownership of the case can be transferred between organization units using the "move permanently" functionality, or simply referred for services, using the "one time referral" function. The program can also be configured to allow for many/all org units to have access to provide services (or "register events") even without transferring ownership. To do this, one needs to first click on the “make referral” button

![Referral](resources/images/referral.png)

This will open the referral window, which will allow for a one time referral or a permanent transfer:

![Referral](resources/images/referral2.png)

### Program Rules { #program-rules }

## Analíticas { #analytics }

### Dashboards and Indicators { #dashboards-and-indicators }

Six dashboards are included in the metadata package, based on program indicators and indicators derived from HIV Case Surveillance program data. By default, dashboards are accessible to all users with access to the HIV Case Surveillance program.

Each of these dashboards is described in the table below.

-   Case Reporting and Demographics
-   ART Linkage & Retention
-   Viral Load
-   TB Preventive Treatment
-   Epidemic Status\*
-   Facility Monitoring

\*Note that for comparison purposes, some dashboard items in the Epidemic Status dashboard depend on Official Spectrum Estimates of HIV prevalence. These estimates can be entered as aggregate data in the “PLHIV Estimates” program for any geographic level and year they are available.

### Dashboard Overview { #dashboard-overview }

Dashboard name, description, and data use questions

**HIV CS - 1. Case Reporting & Demographics**

![Dashboard 1](resources/images/Dashboard1.png)

Newly reported cases by month, geography, and key population group. Cumulative cases registered by age ranges, gender.

-   How has registration of new HIV cases changed this year compared to last?
-   Have most new HIV cases also initiated ART?
-   Is the epidemic concentrated in a certain KP group or region?

**HIV CS - 2. ART Linkage & Retention**

![Dashboard 2](resources/images/Dashboard2.png)

Cumulative cases that initiate and continue ART on a routine basis. Examines patient status reported last month, and attrition or mortality over time.

-   How has linkage to ART improved over time? Are there any hotspot districts or clinics where ART linkage is significantly lower?
-   How many patients initiated ART on the same day of their positive test result?
-   How many within 14 days?
-   What are the patterns of patients lost to follow up at visits last month by gender? By district?
-   Has ART attrition generally increased in the last 6 months?

**HIV CS - 3. Viral Load**

![Dashboard 3](resources/images/Dashboard3.png)

Viral Load testing coverage and viral load suppression among all patients on ART more than 6 months.

-   Are 95% of cases with have a viral load test in viral load suppression?
-   Has that improved since last year?
-   Of all cases that have been on ART for at least 6 months and are still active, how many have ever had a viral load test?
-   Last month, how many cases that had their first visit after 6 months on ART also had a viral load test in the month? Does this vary by district?

**HIV CS - 4. TB Preventive Treatment**

![Dashboard 4](resources/images/Dashboard4.png)

TB Prevention Therapy (TPT) initiation and completion, cumulative by ange and gender, as well as TPT Regimens.

-   What is the cascade of total HIV cases with TPT eligibility, initiation, and completion this year?
-   Have completion rates for TPT increased over the past 12 months?
-   Are eligible adults more likely to initiate TPT than eligible children?
-   Are there patterns by gender?

**HIV CS - 5. Epidemic Status**

![Dashboard 5](resources/images/Dashboard5.png)

HIV Cascade with case surveillance data plus aggregate spectrum estimates as annual population-level denominators.

-   Is my region reaching 95/95/95 targets?
-   Are enough cases enrolled in the HIV CS Tracker to compare with the national spectrum estimate for total cases identified?
-   How have cases with VL suppression increased this year compared to the end of last year?
-   Over the preceding 6 months, how many PLHIV have initiated ART?

**HIV CS - Facility Monitoring**

![Dashboard 6](resources/images/Dashboard6.png)

Encounter-based indicators specifically designed for monitoring HIV CS roll-out at facility level, including new cases on ART, testing site, and latest status not on ART. -What was the most common age and gender combination for new cases last month? -Have “lost-to-follow-up” reports increased or decreased over prior 12 months at my facility? -What was the most frequent reason for patient visits over the last 3 months? -Which patients had reportedly discontinued ART last month at my facility?

### Indicators and Program Indicators { #indicators-and-program-indicators }

Included within the package there are 116 program indicators and XYZ indicators, based on individual-level data gathered in the Tracker system. As a general rule, program indicators count HIV cases meeting specific criteria; indicators are percentages based on those counts. These program indicators and indicators populate charts, maps, and tables which are shown on the dashboards.

Special attention should be made to program indicators marked “cumulative”, which identify all cases that meet the specified criteria before the end of a given period, regardless of when they enrolled in the system, and make use of open “analytic period boundaries”. Note that additional disaggregation of all program indicators can be configured for local context through consulting the DHIS2 User Guide.

### Ownership limitations for indicators { #ownership-limitations-for-indicators }

If a program indicator analyzes patient data entered across two events or more, this is made possible through an*enrollment-type* program indicator.

Currently, DHIS2 program indicators cannot differentiate between the \_ownership_org unit and the \_enrollment_org unit. In practical terms, this means that when a patient has moved between sites, all longitudinal indicators for this patient are not re-assigned to the patient’s latest site, and remain assigned to the initial site where the patient first entered the program.

This is a critical limitation of DHIS2 analytics which package implementers must consider, especially when interpreting longitudinal case surveillance indicators such as mortality rates and attrition rates. Tracker analytics based on record’s ownership org unit is not currently supported by the DHIS2 indicator engine, but will be made available in future releases of DHIS2.

Until this is part of the core functionality, the workarounds are to rely on national indicators, or to use a script to change the enrollment org unit to the owner org unit. For more information about this workaround see the installation guide

## Metadata { #metadata }

On our github repository you can find the link to the latest version of the metadata. Note that this is not the final version of this package and it will be updated as soon as possible: [Link to github](https://github.com/dhis2/metadata-package-development/tree/master/metadata/HIV_Tracker)

## Android Compatibility { #android-compatibility }

The package is natively compatible with the DHIS2 Data Capture app for android. There are, however, some considerations to be aware of when implementing this package with android devices:

### Automatically Assigned UiDs { #automatically-assigned-uids }

If you will be using android devices, and you will be using automatically generated IDs which are sequential or based on dates, you need to be aware that in order to be able to work offline, android devices reserve sets of UiDs in bulk in advance. This means that the UiDs assigned may not necessarily correspond with the chronological order in which the patients are registered. For more information see [here](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/android-implementation/dhis2-configuration-for-android.html#implementation_guide_dhis2_config_reserved_id).

### Search Functionality { #search-functionality }

Note that for android-based implementations, if you want users to be able to search clients in a different org unit than their own, the search settings MUST be set to “open” as the other search features are not fully supported. More information available [here](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/full/implement/dhis2-android-configuration-guide.html).
