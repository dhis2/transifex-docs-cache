# BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT / Tracker program { #biomedical-engineering-life-cycle-management-tracker-program } 

## Introduction { #introduction } 

This simple Tracker program provides an asset register similar to the product catalogue which can be customized to any type of biomedical equipment, including but not limited to cold chain equipment. In addition, this mobile application allows maintaining a detailed record of installation, alarm record, equipment status, servicing, repair and disposal and thereby covering the entire life cycle of biomedical equipment with records available to health care facility staff off-line and to any other other authorized staff anywhere in the country through the web portal.

## Use case { #use-case } 

The biomedical engineering or cold chain technician team establishes a detailed asset register for each health care facility or uploads data from a national database. Biomedical engineers or technicians document the installation, testing, commissioning and initial training when setting up new pieces of equipment. Health staff and/or technicians carry out period (daily/weekly/monthly) equipment checks and document alarm events, causes as well as resolution. Biomedical engineers and/or technicians maintain a detailed record for each servicing or repair which documents works, parts repaired or replaced and testing. Finally, when the equipment reaches the end of its useful life time, the decommissioning and disposal of equipment is documented before removing it from the asset register.

## Maintenance Web App - DHIS2 metadata configuration { #maintenance-web-app-dhis2-metadata-configuration } 

This application is configured as a "Tracker program" which uses only simple, native DHIS2 functionality. The number, description and contents of each of the stages can be very easily customized to national protocols and needs without the need for any programming knowledge.
The "aggregate" Data entry form is used for storing and visualizing aggregate daily and monthly data but not used for entering data.

### Metadata overview { #metadata-overview } 
The required metadata settings seetings are presented in the order in which it is presented in the DHIS2 Maintenance Web App.

### 2 DATA ELEMENT { #2-data-element }

>**1 Xx**  
>>**Name \(*)**: "Xx"

>
>**Short name \(*)**: same as "Name (\*) - CCE"   
>**Domain Type \(*)**: "Tracker"  
>**Value type \(*)**: "Long text"
>**Aggregation type (*)**: "None"

#### 2.3 Data element group { #23-data-element-group } 

The creation of Data element groups is a DHIS2 best practice but also a precondition for using the "Group Predictor" functionality which allows using a placeholder and the Data element group ID for creating a single Predictor which is automatically applied to all Data elements in the respective Data element group. For example for calculating the stock coverage time.

>**1 Xx**  
>**Name \(*)**: "Xx"  
>**Short name \(*)**: "Xx"
>**Data elements \(*)**: *select all Data elements with the "DAY" suffix"*    
>****
>**X**  
>**Name \(*)**: "X"  
>**Short name \(*)**: "Xx"
>**Data elements \(*)**: *select all Data elements with the "MTH" suffix"*    

### 3 DATA SET { #3-data-set } 
#### 3.1 Data set { #31-data-set } 
Data sets for each Organisation unit are required both for recording daily and monthly "snapshots" of Tracker Program .

>**Xx**  
>>**Name \(*)**: "Xx"  
>>**Short name \(*)**: "Xx"  
>>**Expiry days**: "5"  
>>**Open future periods for data entry**: "1"  
>>**Days after period to qualify for timely submission**: "5"  
>>**Period type**: "Monthly"  
>>**Category combination**: "None"  
>>**Data elements**
>>>"Data elements: add all Data elements with the suffix "XXX" required for the respective health facility.
>>
>>**Organisation units selected**: (select as for the Tracker Program) 

### 4 INDICATOR { #4-indicator } 

The Indicator functionality is used to configure the "Stock coverage time". In principle it would be preferable to configure the "Stock coverage time" as Predictor (as it would allow using the "Group predictor" function) but because the "Stock coverage time" requires displaying decimals and the Data Entry form only allows a single number format for all Category Options, an indicator is used instead. This approach allows freely setting the number of decimals in the Indicator settings.

#### 4.1 Program indicator { #41-program-indicator } 

Program indicators in conjunction with Predictors allow automatically aggregating Tracker Program data and recording daily and monthly aggregate values in the respective Data Entry forms for analysis and reporting.

A separate Program indicator has to be created for every "pair" of item description and transaction type and one example is given below for each of the transactions for one item:

>**1 [Data element] - Xx**  
>>**1 Program indicator details**
>>>**Program \(*)**: "Xx"  
>>>**Name \(*)**: "[Data element] - Xx"  
>>>**Short Name \(*)**: "[Item code] - XX"  
>>>**Aggregation type \(*)**: "Sum"  
>>>**Analytics type**: "Event"  
>>>**Organisation unit field**: "Event organisation unit (default)  
>>>**Analytics period boundaries**  
>>>>**Boundary target**: "Event date"  
>>>>**Analytics period boundary target**: "Before end of reporting period"  
>>>>**Offset period by amount**: "0"  
>>>>**Boundary target**: "Event date"  
>>>>**Analytics period boundary target**: "After start of reporting period"  
>>>>**Offset period by amount**: "0"  
>>>
>>>**Display in form**: tag (appears as white tick in blue square)  

### 5 ORGANISATION UNIT { #5-organisation-unit } 

#### 5.1 Organisation Unit { #51-organisation-unit } 
The Organisation Unit, Organisation Unit group and Organisation Unit level are created and added according to national protocols and policies and/or existing DHIS2 configuration and there are no specific requirements for using the Biomedical EQuipment Life Cycle Management program.

### 6 PROGRAUM { #6-prograum } 
The DHIS2 Tracker Program, which lies at the core of the DHIS2-RTS application, is very simple to configure, uses only native DHIS2 functionality and governs the customized user interface on the mobile device.

#### 6.2 Tracked entity attribute { #62-tracked-entity-attribute } 
The DHIS2-RTS uses the "Item code" and "Item descriptions" as the two Tracked entity attributes of the Trached entity type "Item".
Note that the "Item code" is unique only for any specific Organisation Unit but the same "Item code" can be used in any number of different Organisation Units.

# LL - Line Listing Web App - Transaction Analytics and Visualizations { #ll-line-listing-web-app-transaction-analytics-and-visualizations } 

The Line Listing reports provide details of individual transactions but are not able to provide any type of aggregation.

Important notice: the "Last updated on" date and time stamp indicates the actual date that respective transaction was made on the mobile device (and not the date and time of synchronization). The time indicated in the Line Listing corresponds to the time set on the mobile device (which should ideally corresopnd to the DHIS2 server time).
