# COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery (COVIDVAC) Aggregate System Design Guide - Version 1.1.0 { #cvc-agg-design }

## 1. Introduction { #1-introduction } 

The version 1.1.0 of the aggregate COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery (COVIDVAC) metadata package has been developed as an installable solution for countries to update their DHIS2-based HMIS and immunization data systems according to the updated version of the[WHO Guidance on developing a national deployment and vaccination plan for COVID-19](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/monitoring-covid-19-vaccination-interim-guidance).

The COVIDVAC Aggregate System Design document provides an overview of the design principles and global technical guidance used to develop a WHO standard metadata package for monitoring COVID-19 vaccination delivery. This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localisation of the package. The COVIDVAC metadata package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines.

This metadata package can be used for direct electronic reporting by vaccination site staff or higher-level staff, or as a set of "target" metadata for aggregation of individual level data from electronic, mobile or paper-based collection tools. The analytics and dashboards included in these packages are designed to support the routine analysis and use of Covid-19 vaccine data at national and sub-national levels.

## 2. Background { #2-background } 

This aggregate design has developed new aggregate reporting requirements from the aforementioned WHO guidance document**.** The COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery digital data package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing the data originating from the planned/undertaken immunization efforts. UiO has developed the COVIDVAC packages both for aggregated and individual data in order to enable countries to select the model that is most appropriate for their context given the workload and available resources. These models and their relative benefits/limitations are summarized below:

**Aggregate Data Package:**

- Enables daily reporting of key aggregate data points about vaccination activities and stock management.
- Low complexity, easy to implement. Most manageable when cases numbers are high, or wherever individual data entry is not possible due to the complexity of the tracker instance or to the burden of the vaccination activities compared to the data entry ones.

**Individual Data Package (Tracker):**

- Enrolls a case and tracks over time the vaccination schedules of the patients
- Highly granular data and multiple time dimensions for analysis, can support decentralized workflow, all events linked to the case.

**This document covers only the design of the version 1.1.0 of the aggregate package.** Separate system design documents are available for the COVAC DHIS2 Tracker package and for the COVAC aggregate package version 1.0.0

The aggregate package is designed to meet the most critical reporting requirements and analytical capacities for the monitoring of the vaccination activities.

The objectives of the COVIDVAC aggregated package are:

1. to monitor the vaccination activities and their evolution within the target populations;
2. rapidly detect uptake trends as much as red flags as drop-out rates;
3. provide geographical information about the roll-out of the vaccination efforts;
4. provide information about stock management and quality data on waste.

The system design builds upon existing disease surveillance and vaccination guidelines principles and information system requirements that have been developed collaboratively between the WHO and UiO since 2017.

National guidelines and policies may vary and it is recommended to adapt this package to local contexts.

### 2.1 Version 1.1.0 vs Version 1.0.0 { #21-version-110-vs-version-100 } 

The COVIDVAC version of the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Package (version 1.1.0) is an optimization of the COVAC COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Package (version 1.0.0). It has been developed to support the data collection and reporting tools in the WHO AFRO Region.

Despite some differences (listed below), the COVIDVAC version as much as the COVAC version match and support the global and regional reporting requirements such as the [eJRF](https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/routine/reporting/en/).

The main differences between the two versions are:

- The age disaggregation: Adult/Older adult VS 0-59 years/60+ years
- The addition of the disaggregation by Existing underlying condition/No underlying condition in the “Vaccination Delivery Dataset” VS the Number of people with underlying conditions as a subset of the total population receiving a vaccine dose.
- The presence of a list of available vaccines as an attribute of the “Vaccination Delivery Dataset” VS the disaggregation of the data by Vaccine 1,2,3.
- Similarly, a list of available vaccines is present in the “Vaccine Stock Dataset” VS the disaggregation of the data by Vaccine 1,2,3.
- The “Population Dataset” can be edited depending on the availability of demographic data.
- The constants are all the vaccines available at present VS general placeholders Vaccine 1,2,3.

Detailed information on the COVIDVAC datasets and sections are available in the [Section 4](#4.-datasets) of this document.

Should countries decide to switch versions, a mapping of the DEs and Indicators that can be used to continue the analysis of the data is available in the [Section 10](#10.-mapping-of-covidvac-and-covac-indicators-for-analysis) of this document.

## 3. System Design Summary { #3-system-design-summary } 

In the development of this configuration package, an effort has been made to follow UiO's [general design principles](https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/general_design_principles.html) and a common [naming convention](https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/naming_convention.html).

The aggregate COVIDVAC package includes:

1. Daily aggregate data set and data elements for key Covid-19 vaccination delivery
2. Daily aggregate data set and data element for key stock management supervision
3. Annual aggregate dataset for the target population groups
4. Core indicators for both datasets
5. Dashboard

The package captures a minimum number of data points that meet the current WHO reporting requirements. These will generate a core set of indicators feeding the dashboard for national and sub-national decision-makers to rapidly analyse and respond to odd trends and numbers.

**1)** **COVIDVAC - Vaccination Delivery**

- Daily periodicity

Purpose: Reporting of key COVID-19 vaccination efforts - data including doses, vaccine type, vial waste, AEFIs, and available staff at point of care.

**2)** **COVIDVAC - Vaccine stock**

- Daily periodicity

- Purpose: Reporting of key stock management data - doses, stock listing of vials and other core items

**3)** **COVIDVAC - Population**

- Yearly periodicity

- Purpose: Setting the total or disaggregated targets of the population to vaccinate.

It is recommended that the Vaccination Report and the Vaccine Stock datasets get assigned to **Organisation Units at the lowest level of the health system** feasible for reporting data, such as health facilities. The Target Population dataset could instead be assigned at district level or at the same level as the other two datasets depending on the availability of detailed population-related information.

Digital data packages are optimized for Android data collection with the DHIS2 Capture App, free to download on the [GooglePlay store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhis2&hl=en).

### 3.1 Intended users { #31-intended-users } 

- Health facility users: capture and report key data on vaccine administration and waste at point of care.

- Logistics and Supply Managers: capture and report key data on the stock of vaccines and other items.

- National and local health authorities: monitor and analyse the evolution of the vaccination activities, and generate reports for regional and global reporting

## 4. Datasets { #4-datasets } 

The Vaccination delivery and the Stock datasets are designed to have as attribute the COVID-19 vaccines based on the categoryCombo “COVIDVAC Vaccines (attrib)” that bases on the options of the vaccines listed. Whenever entering data for this dataset, the user will have to select the vaccine delivered on the given period in order to start registering the collected data. From an analytic point of view, this translates into the possibility of filtering the analysis of any data point in the dataset by vaccine.

![Data entry](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_1.png)

### 4.1 COVIDVAC - Vaccination Delivery Data Entry Form { #41-covidvac-vaccination-delivery-data-entry-form } 

#### Section 1: Doses administered to front line health care workers (HCWs) { #section-1-doses-administered-to-front-line-health-care-workers-hcws } 

![Doses - health workers](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_2.png)

Data should be entered for all the vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) according to the received dose. The data can be broken down by adulthood (Adult vs Older adults - **older adults** are defined as the fraction of the population deemed at risk by the National guidelines), by sex (male and female), and by the existence of underlying medical conditions (Underlying condition and No underlying condition). The data entry form already provides the totals by row and columns as an added verification of the correctness of the data.

#### Section 2: Doses administered to essential workers { #section-2-doses-administered-to-essential-workers } 

![Doses - essential workers](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_3.png)

This section captures the number of doses administered to essential workers - the definition of essential workers can vary between countries and should be adapted and defined accordingly. The data should be entered according to the received dose. The data can be broken down by by adulthood (Adult vs Older adults - older adults are defined as the fraction of the population deemed at risk by the National guidelines), by sex (male and female), and by the existence of underlying medical conditions (Underlying condition and No underlying condition). The data entry form already provides the totals by row and columns as an added verification of the correctness of the data.

#### Section 3: Doses administered to the “Other” population { #section-3-doses-administered-to-the-other-population } 

![Doses - other population](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_4.png)

This section captures the number of doses administered to the section of the **“Other population”**, meaning the fraction of the population that does not fall in any other population group according to the local breakdown and organization of the immunization activities. The data is mutually exclusive among the different sections, meaning that the data inserted in this section represent all the people who are not categorized as HCWs nor as essential workers. The data should be entered according to the received dose. The data can be broken down by by adulthood (Adult vs Older adults - older adults are defined as the fraction of the population deemed at risk by the National guidelines), by sex (male and female), and by the existence of underlying medical conditions (Underlying condition and No underlying condition). The data entry form already provides the totals by row and columns as an added verification of the correctness of the data.

#### Section 4: Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) { #section-4-adverse-events-following-immunization-aefis } 

![AEFI](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_5.png)

This section collects the information on AEFIs by the seriousness of the event. For more information on AEFIs or serious vs non serious events you can refer to the [COVID-19 Vaccines: Safety Surveillance Manual](https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/Module_AEFI.pdf?ua=1) or to the [WHO’s Global Vaccine Safety](https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/AEFI/en/) webpage.

#### Section 5: Discarded doses by reason { #section-5-discarded-doses-by-reason } 

![Discarded doses](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_6.png)

This section is set up to report how many doses have been discarded, why, and whether they were belonging to an open or closed vial.

#### Section 6: Staff availability at PoC { #section-6-staff-availability-at-poc } 

![Staff availability](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_7.png)

This section is aimed at providing a snapshot of the availability of medical staff during the roll-out of the vaccination activities.

### 4.2 COVAX - Vaccine Stock Data Entry Form { #42-covax-vaccine-stock-data-entry-form } 

#### Section 1: Vaccine stock status { #section-1-vaccine-stock-status } 

![Vaccine stock status](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_8.png)

The section has been preconfigured with the list of available vaccines. The list will have to be adapted locally based on the vaccine availability. The first column of the table is a "read-only" section that will be pre-configured using constants This should be updated as explained in the section for [Constants metadata](#7.constants). Based on these constants, each of the components of the stock status will automatically calculate the number of doses based on the vials entered in the dataset.

#### Section 2: Stock status of other items { #section-2-stock-status-of-other-items } 

![Stock status - other](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_9.png)

This section provides the core info for the management of other items needed during vaccination activities (e.g. syringes, cold boxes). The closing balance will be automatically calculated. A predictor will also automatically populate the Opening Balance with the Stock on hand reported in the previous period depending on the routine periodicity of reporting.

### 4.3 COVIDVAC - Population (Annual) Data Entry Form { #43-covidvac-population-annual-data-entry-form } 

This dataset can either be assigned at district or health site level depending on the availability of updated and reliable demographic data.

The dataset has been designed to be flexible on the front of the availability of demographic data - each section has an increasing level of disaggregation. Countries are therefore not expected to fill in all the sections. In turn, this means that upon the package’s implementation, the unnecessary sections could be removed according to the data available locally. Depending on the chosen section, the analysis of the data will have to consider the different denominators to monitor coverage.

#### Section 1: Total population { #section-1-total-population } 

![Total population](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_10.png)

This is the most basic demographic info that can be entered into the system. Countries are advised to use this first section if the demographic data are very approximate and are not available in any required breakdown.

If countries enter their target population in section one, they are not expected to enter any other section.

Indicators to be used: COVIDVAC - Total population and COVIDVAC - Population coverage (%)

#### Section 2: Total target populations { #section-2-total-target-populations } 

![Total target populations](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_11.png)

This section requires the aggregated totals of the target populations disaggregated by type of priority group. The priority groups are to be defined locally according to the National vaccination delivery system. The sum of the different totals should give the overall total population to be covered by the vaccination activities. Again, if countries are choosing to enter these demographic data, they are not expected to enter section 1 and 3, which therefore can be removed from the dataset.

Indicators to be used: COVIDVAC - Total frontline healthcare workers, COVIDVAC - Total essential workers, COVIDVAC - Total other population, COVIDVAC - Coverage among HCWs (%), COVIDVAC - Coverage among essential workers (%), COVIDVAC - Coverage among Others (%), and COVIDVAC - Total coverage (%).

#### Section 3: Disaggregated target populations { #section-3-disaggregated-target-populations } 

![Disaggregated target populations](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_12.png)

This is the most extensive section of the dataset and to be used if the demographic data available in place by target priority groups can be disaggregated by adulthood and sex. If this section 3 is chosen, section 2 and 1 are not required for data entry.

Indicators to be used: COVIDVAC - Target frontline healthcare workers, COVIDVAC - Target essential workers, COVIDVAC - Target other population, COVIDVAC - Coverage target HCW (%), COVIDVAC - Coverage target essential workers (%), COVIDVAC - Coverage target Others (%), and COVIDVAC - Coverage target overall population.

#### Section 4: People with underlying conditions { #section-4-people-with-underlying-conditions } 

![People with underlying conditions](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_13.png)

The last section is for countries that have a good estimation of the numbers of people affected by underlying medical conditions. They can either decide to enter the total number of people with at least one underlying medical condition, or they can enter the same data by adulthood and sex. Depending on the chosen table, countries will be able to monitor the specific coverage of either COVIDVAC - Coverage target people with underlying conditions (%) OR COVIDVAC - Coverage among people with underlying conditions (%).

## 5. Adapting the Custom Data Entry Forms { #5-adapting-the-custom-data-entry-forms } 

The dataset for stock management in this package contains a custom form used to improve the usability of the form for data entry. As Implementers adapt this package, it may require that edits be made to suit the needs and requirements of the country implementation. Changes on custom will mainly emerge from the vaccines used in the country and therefore it will require reviewing  the options in the category for “COVIDVAC Vaccines (attrib)” and then making the necessary adjustments on the form. For more information regarding use and management of custom forms please refer to  the DHIS2 User manual: [https://docs.dhis2.org/2.33/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en_full.html#manage_customform](https://docs.dhis2.org/2.33/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en_full.html#manage_customform)

## 6. Data Elements { #6-data-elements } 

The following data elements have been created and used to design the dataSet and all the related metadata. All COVIDVAC data elements are assigned to the data element Group 'COVIDVAC - Vaccination delivery'.

## 9. Dashboard { #9-dashboard } 

The package includes a predefined dashboard (COVIDVAC - COVID-19 Vaccination Delivery) where the users will be able to have an at glance overview of the vaccination activities as much as of the status of the status.

The first part of the dashboard covers the vaccination activities and the population (1st doses, uptake, coverage, 2nd dose, staff availability, drop-outs, and AEFIs).

![Dashboard](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_14.png)

The second part of the dashboard covers the overview of the stock status of the vaccines and of the other items reported. Moreover it provides useful insights such as discrepancy rates, stockout days, and vaccine usage.

![Dashboard](resources/images/COVAC_AGG_1.1.0_15.png)

## 10. Mapping of COVIDVAC and COVAC indicators for analysis { #10-mapping-of-covidvac-and-covac-indicators-for-analysis } 

Here below a list of indicators that can be used for continuity analysis in order to bridge the version 1.0.0 (COVAC) and the version 1.1.0 (COVIDVAC).

|1.0.0 (COVAC)|1.1.0 (COVIDVAC)|Notes and Comments|
|COVAC - People given 1st dose|COVIDVAC - Overall number of 1st doses given|The COVAC IND can be added to the COVIDVAC - Cumulative number of administered 1st doses graph|
|COVAC - People given 2nd dose|COVIDVAC - Overall number of 2nd doses given|The COVAC IND can be added to the COVIDAC - Cumulative number of administered 2nd doses graph|
|COVAC - Essential workers given 1st dose <br> COVAC - Frontline healthcare workers given 1st dose|COVIDVAC - Essential workers: Number of 1st doses given <br> COVIDVAC - HCW: Number of 1st doses given||
|COVAC - Essential workers given 2nd dose <br> COVAC - Frontline healthcare workers given 2nd dose|COVIDVAC - Essential workers: Number of 2nd doses given <br> COVIDVAC - HCW: Number of 2nd doses given|The COVAC IND can be added as part of the COVIDVAC - Cumulative number of 2nd doses by priority groups graph or the different groups can be mapped in separate new graphs *|
|COVAC - Drop out rates among people targeted|COVIDVAC - Overall drop-out rates (%)|The COVAC ind can be added as part of the COVIDVAC - Drop-out rates through time graph|
|COVAC - Drop out rates among essential workers <br> COVAC - Drop out rates among frontline health care workers|COVIDVAC - Essential workers: Drop-out rates (%) <br> COVIDVAC - HCW: Drop-out rates (%)|The COVAC INDs can be added to the COVIDVAC - Drop-out rates through time by priority group graph. *|
|COVAC . Proportion of target people given 1st dose|COVIDVAC - Essential workers: Vaccine uptake (%) <br> COVIDVAC - Other population: Vaccine uptake (%) <br> COVIDVAC - HCW: Vaccine uptake (%)|In COVIDVAC the uptake is measured by population groups. <br> A COVIDVAC Continuity Indicator for the whole population would need to have <br> (COVIDVAC - HCW given 1st dose + COVIDVAC - Essential workers given 1st dose + COVIDVAC - Others given 1st dose) in the numerator <br> and (COVIDVAC - HCW given 1st dose + COVIDVAC - Essential workers given 1st dose + COVIDVAC - Others given 1st dose + COVIDVAC - HCW given 2nd dose + COVIDVAC - Essential workers given 2nd dose + COVIDVAC - Others given 2nd dose) as denominator *|
|COVAC - Proportion of staff available|COVIDVAC - Staff availability (%)|The COVAC IND can be added to the COVIDVAC - Staff availability graph|
|COVAC - Serious / Non serious AEFI|COVIDVAC - Severe / Non severe reported AEFIs|The COVAC INDs can be added to the COVIDVAC - Severe AEFIs by vaccine  and COVIDVAC - Non-severe AEFIs by vaccine if the vaccines are matching. Otherwise new graphs can be created to simply map the number of severe and non severe AEFI cases.|


***** Please note that the People with underlying conditions is no longer a population group in version 1.1.0. Continuity indicators for underlying conditions can therefore be created for the total population rather than for the different target groups due to the lack of mutual exclusivity in version 1.0.0. The disaggregation by underlying conditions is exclusive to the population group under which the condition, or lack thereof, is tallied.

The **stock Indicators** are virtually the same with the difference of the COVAC / COVIDVAC prefix. Mapping them in the COVIDVAC graphs would simply imply adding them to the analysis of the items in the predefined COVIDVAC dashboard.
