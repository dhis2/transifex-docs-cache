# APK Distribution Web App { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp }
## Overview { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp_overview }

This section focuses on the [APK Distribution Web App](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/dff273fc-909e-48af-b151-c4d7e9c8a12c) implementation.

The [APK Distribution Web App](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/dff273fc-909e-48af-b151-c4d7e9c8a12c) enables implementation administrators to manage and control the version of the Android app, making it easier to manage app updates and ensure compatibility with the DHIS2 system. 

Admins will be able to upload the desired version and users will get a prompt message to update when they are not in the last updated version.

Please note that in this version of the Web App, only users with "ALL" authority are able to define the Android app versions. Other users having access to the web app can see the version history list and download the latest version, but cannot edit them.

## Installation { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp_installation }

A user can easily install the Use Case Configuration Web App by logging into the DHIS2 and going to **App Management**.

- Klikněte na **App Hub**
- Go to *APK Distribution App*
- Click on *Install V1.X.X*

## Log in and first time setup { #capture_app_apk_distribution_webapp_webapp_login }

After a user installs and launches the APK Distribution Web App for the first time, the web app will require saving the default values of the configuration. This will allow android devices connect to the instance.

> **Warning**
>
> Only users with 'ALL' authority are able to *upload or delete* APK versions, but any user will have view access once it's created.

> **Note:**
>
> App versions must follow semantic versioning. Read more about [semantic versions](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning). 
>
> When uploading a new apk, make sure that the app version is higher than the current/latest version.

> 
> To choose the minimum or recommended Android OS version for the app version, it is suggested to review the [Mobile Device Specification documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/android-implementation/mobile-device-specifications.html).

> **Note:**
>
> The APK Distribution web application empowers administrators to allocate access to user groups for specific "Android App" versions.
> - User groups can be assigned to multiple "Android app" versions, yet individual users within those groups will only have access to the latest version allocated to their group. 
> - It's feasible to refrain from assigning a user group to an "Android app" version. In such cases, all users within that instance will automatically gain access to that version. 
> - In instances where no user group is assigned to any "Android app" version, the latest version will be designated as the *Default*. Consequently, only the latest version will be accessible to all users within the instance.
>
