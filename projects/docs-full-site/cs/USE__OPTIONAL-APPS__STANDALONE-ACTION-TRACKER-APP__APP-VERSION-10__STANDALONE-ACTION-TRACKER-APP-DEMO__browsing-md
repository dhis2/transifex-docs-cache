## Actions planning { #actions-planning } 

The first part of using the standalone action tracker allows users to document actions related to plans that they have done. Users will be able to use this section to define interventions, manage indicators and assignment of responsible entities for each action documented.


###  Managing intervention { #managing-intervention } 

Defining an intervention is the first step for tracking actions. Before users can define what action needs to be taken, they have to define the intervention they want to focus on. Definition of interventions allows creation of linkage of actions to be tracked with indicators. Linking interventions with indicators will allow users to be able to easily track impact of their actions (as indicators performance improves or worsen).


#### Adding intervention { #adding-intervention } 

To define an intervention whose corresponding actions should be tracked, the user should click on Add intervention tab. User can provide a description of the intervention to be tracked and select corresponding indicators.
